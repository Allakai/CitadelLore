Discovered in [2241](/wiki/Timeline#2540s "wikilink") by
[NanoTrasen](/wiki/NanoTrasen "wikilink"), the Virgo-Erigone system was named
after Erigone, daughter of Icarius of Athens. Icarius, who had been
favored by Dionysus, was killed by his shepherds while they were
intoxicated, after which Erigone hanged herself in grief. In some
versions of the myth, Dionysus is said to have placed the father and
daughter in the stars as Bo√∂tes and Virgo respectively.

Virgo can be found along the same vector as Spica along the galactic
plane from Earth. The star system was originally named Virgo because of
a cartography entry mistake that initially described the star being
within the Virgo constellation, even though the coordinates were
completely wrong. This name was later changed to Erigone when the error
was corrected, but by then, star maps were already programmed to direct
searches for Virgo to the new system, while Erigone did not turn up an
entry at all. Rather than correct the mistake, and replace Virgo with
Erigone, NanoTrasen decided to change the official name to
Virgo-Erigone, so as to avoid confusion among pilots. This way, both
entries of Virgo or Erigone will bring your navigation computer to the
correct system.

The Virgo-Erigone system is a home to the [Virgo Orbital Research
Establishment](/wiki/Virgo_Orbital_Research_Establishment "wikilink").

In the early days of Vorestation, it was initially called the Venus
Orbital Research Establishment, and was said to be orbiting Venus. This
was quickly changed however, as it contradicted established Space
Station 13 lore, of which [Ace](/wiki/User%3AAces "wikilink") wanted to stay
true to the spirit of.

The first version of the Virgo-Erigone star was supposed to be placed
somewhere in the Virgo constellation, but this was later retconned as
any undiscovered star along that trajectory would have put the star
system outside of the [Milky Way](/wiki/Milky_Way "wikilink").
