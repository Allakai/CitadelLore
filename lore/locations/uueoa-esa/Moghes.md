**Moghes**, in the Uueoa-Esa system, is the homeworld of the
[Unathi](/wiki/Unathi "wikilink"), and the capital of the Moghes Hegemony.

The average temperature on Moghes is a warm 23C. For the most part, the
surface of Moghes is land, with massive saltwater lakes and seas dotting
the supercontinent's surface. The tropical band on Moghes is mostly hot,
rocky plains with occasional stretches of desert, while the temperate
band is mostly swampland and savannas, while the poles are mostly
swampland. The Northernmost polar region is a relatively cold plain,
with very unusual life, as Moghes' moon **Kharet** is locked in orbit
above this part of the planet. Moghes was once abundant in precious
metals and other minerals, in modern times the supply is running low and
the Unathi are forced to turn to other planets or asteroids to obtain
what they need, this his had led to several conflicts where they've
taken what they want from others.

-   City-Holds - Unathi build and live in City-Holds, massive
    industrial-residential complexes focused on enabling the works of
    the Unathi inhabiting them. These are often focussed into a more
    specific area of industry or craft.
-   Outside of the City-Holds, the land is dominated by farming and
    ranching. More space is needed to feed the carnivorous Unathi than
    most other species would allow for. This farmland is traced with
    roads and train tracks, mostly used for shipping goods and
    livestock.

Astrology
---------

-   **Uueoa-Esa** - A blue main sequence star, Uueoa-Esa, roughly
    translated to Burning Mother, is the star that gives its name to the
    home system of the Unathi. It is orbited by three planets, and an
    asteroid belt that may have once been a further two.
-   **Ouere** - The innermost planet to Uueoa-Esa. The only facility of
    note on Ouere is a solar power station on the on the surface, that
    beams power back to Moghes./
-   **Moghes** - See Above
-   **Kahret** - Tidally locked to Moghes, its only moon, Kahret, has an
    atmosphere and biosphere of its own, though nothing classified as
    intelligent was located. Some Unathi scientists theorize that Moghes
    and Kahret were once a larger planet, split by some ancient impact.
-   **Yeora** - The only gas giant in the Uueoa-Esa system, Yeora is
    orbitted by dozens of moons of various sizes. Some of these have
    small Unathi colonies or research facilities.
-   **Yoos** - Not actually a planet, the Yoos Asteroid Belt has been
    mined by the Unathi since their early space faring days. The mineral
    richness of the belt leads some to argue that it was once another
    planet, or up to three. The debate rages.

Flora
-----

Although Moghes has many varieties of flora, the two known by most
modern Unathi are the Velo plant and the Strangler Vine.

-   **Strangler Vine** - A large, thin vine that grows mostly in the
    Southern swamps, the Strangler vine wraps trees and rock formations
    near its base with strong, flexible vines covered in a stinging
    hair. When these hairs are triggered, the vines constrict, trapping
    the prey and injecting it with a potent sedative. The unconscious
    body is then dropped into the swamp below, likely drowning and
    decaying to feed the plant.
-   **Velo** - A short, thick starch plant with a white fibrous body.
    The root is the primary food source of Stok, and the body is easily
    usable in tailoring, so this plant has made its way to most Unathi
    colonies.

Fauna

### Fauna

Hostile wildlife makes living on Moghes difficult, but many of the
historical predators of Unathi are now farmed for meat. Ranching is more
vital and more dangerous for Unathi because of their love of variety and
dietary necessities.

A **Thresher** is a large predatory quadruped, and has large, poisonous
quills on many parts of its body. They resemble large canines and come
in at around 1.4 meters tall, with an average weight of about 160
pounds. Threshers have a pack mentality and are aggressive towards
Unathi by nature, though they can be domesticated given enough patience
and time.

**Sissalik** are huge, gecko-like creatures that serve as the workhorses
of Unathi society. Almost two meters tall at the shoulder, a Sissalik is
a gentle but predatory giant. They were once used as cavalry mounts, and
while not as immediately dangerous as threshers they are far quicker on
their feet. Their main use in today's society is as a beast of burden,
as well as a source of meat. Sissalik are additionally useful in herding
threshers and stok; a well trained Sissalik almost never samples from
their master's herds.

The **stok** is a reptile native to Moghes, standing less than a meter
tall. Stok are strangely colored, with with colorful scales on their
bodies and feathers adorning their head. They stand on two legs and have
short arms, the feet are digitigrade. Wild stoks spend their days eating
and lounging in the treetops of the swampy regions of Moghes. Farming
Stoks involves preparing tall platforms for this purpose, and most stoks
are too foolish to flee an approaching Unathi rancher.

The **Moghes Duneworm** is a critically endangered delicacy for the
Unathi. Completely blind, this pale creature is omnivorous, tracking
plants and prey alike by sense of smell. According to Unathi legend, the
Duneworm used to grow large enough to devour an adult Unathi whole, but
it has since been hunted to the point of near-extinction for its
succulent meats. Today, the Duneworm is kept alive in certain desert
preserves, and very carefully certified ranches.

Though there are many **aquatic creatures** that call Moghes home, the
lack of oceans means very few are universally known. Unathi do however
find Earth fish to be very tasty.
