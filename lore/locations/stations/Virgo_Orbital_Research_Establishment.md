The , more commonly known as V.O.R.E., is a
[NanoTrasen](/wiki/NanoTrasen "wikilink") science outpost on [a
moon](/wiki/Virgo-3B "wikilink") in orbit around a phoron gas giant that is
part of the [Virgo-Erigone](/wiki/Virgo-Erigone "wikilink") star system. The
original V.O.R.E. was a station that began operation in
[2558](/wiki/Timeline#2550s "wikilink"), three years after the completion of
the [NSS Exodus](/wiki/NSS_Exodus "wikilink") entered service, which the
original NSS Adephagia was based upon.

The current station is a space [tether](tether "wikilink") which opened
in 2561. The station is crewed by approximately 20 to 50 employees who
transfer periodically to and from the [An-Nur
Spaceport](/wiki/Virgo-Prime "wikilink"), NanoTrasen's planet-side hub in the
Virgo-Erigone system.
