The NSV Luna (NanoTrasen Research Vessel Luna) was the first deepspace
ship engineered by NanoTrasen and a general purpose reseach ship.  
Since the decommissioning of BayStation 12, Luna has been the first in
line when it comes to research involving [genetical
enhanchments](/wiki/Geneticist "wikilink"), [Chemistry](Chemistry "wikilink")
and research on the [weapon useablility of the famous
Plasma](/wiki/Plasma_Researcher "wikilink").  
A new thread of research that takes the Luna one step further is the new
prototype [Engine](/wiki/Engine "wikilink"), build around a heart of highly
dense plasma that can on rare occasions be found in [Plasma
Giants](/wiki/Backstory "wikilink").  
Naturally in its nature as a prototype, the ship design was not optimal
and she was refitted, and still is, countless times to adapt to the
everyday life in space. While other ships are being designed at the time
by NanoTrasen engineers and architects, Luna remains a valuable
experience for the future of spacefaring and a strong symbol for the
progress humans made and are still making in their efforts to leave
their dependance to the dying resources of mother earth.

On October 5, 2553, she was stricken from the NanoTrasen Vessel register
as a prototype research vessel due to the rising cost of maintaining her
constantly assaulted hull and left as a target for the weapons research
division. On December 25, 2554 she was heavily damaged by her new place
in the weapons testing and burned up in the Jovian System Atmosphere.
