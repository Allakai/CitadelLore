The Free Trade Union is different from other
[tran-stellars](/wiki/Trans-Stellar_Corporations "wikilink") in that they are
not just a company, but they are a big conglomerate of various traders
and merchants from all over the galaxy. They control a sizable fleet of
vessels of various sizes which are given autonomy from the central
command to engage in trading. They also host a fleet of combat vessels
which respond directly to the central command for defending traders when
necessary. They are in control of many large scale trade stations across
the known galaxy, even in non-human space. Generally, they are
multi-purpose stations but they always keep areas filled with duty-free
shops. Almost anything is sold there and products that are forbidden or
have insanely high taxes in other places are generally sold in the
duty-free shops at very cheap and low prices. <onlyinclude>They are the
creators of the Tradeband language, created specially for being a lingua
franca where every merchant can understand each other independent of
language or nationality.</onlyinclude>

### Corporation History

The Free Trade Union was created in 2410 by Issac Adler, a merchant,
economist, and owner of a small fleet of ships. At this time the "Free
Merchants" were in decay because of the high taxes and tariffs that were
generally applied on the products that they tried to import or export.
Another issue was that big [trans-stellar
corporations](/wiki/Trans-Stellar_Corporations "wikilink") were constantly
blocking their products to prospective buyers in order to form their
monopolies. Issac decided to organize the "Free Merchants" into a
legitimate organization to lobby and protest against the unfair
practices of the major corporations and the governments that were in
their pocket. At the same time, they wanted to organize and sell their
things at better prices. The organization started relatively small but
by 2450 it became one of the biggest conglomerates with a significant
amount of the merchants of the galaxy being a part of the FTU. At the
same time, the Free Trade Union started to popularize tradeband in the
galaxy as *the* language of business. Around 2500, the majority of
independent merchants were part of the FTU with significant influence on
the galactic scale. They have started to invest in colonization efforts
in order to take early claim of the frontier systems as the best choice
for frontier traders.

### Modern Day

Despite the accusations of artificially fixing prices and forming
cartels, the FTU stays as one of the biggest organizations in the galaxy
with a large influence on the exchange of trade goods. Their fleet of
merchants are some of the most efficient in the galaxy and their space
stations are highly profitable. However, the success of the Free Trade
Union attracted the ire of the [trans-stellar
corporations](/wiki/Trans-Stellar_Corporations "wikilink") and the governments
that support them. Despite it all, the trade continues to flow like a
well-oiled machine, wild and free as it is.
