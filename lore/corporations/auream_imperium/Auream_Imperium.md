**The Auream Imperium**, also known as **The Golden Empire**, is a
galactic superpower of [Sylvanusians](/wiki/Sylvanusians "wikilink") living
somewhere in the galaxy's [observational
shadow](observational_shadow "wikilink"). Little is known about them, as
Auream Sylvanusians are a highly secretive society. Only a handful have
been seen in the galaxy at large, all of whom first appeared in the
[Virgo-Erigone](/wiki/Virgo-Erigone "wikilink") system.

[Livius Thraun](/wiki/Livius_Thraun "wikilink") appears to be something of a
grand military leader for the Auream Imperium. He is the only known
government official to be formally in contact with
[SolGov](/wiki/SolGov "wikilink"), and was present for the signing of a treaty
with the [USDF](/wiki/USDF "wikilink"), promising not to intrude on the
quarter of the galaxy in which humanity resides, so long as humanity
also does not attempt to send expeditions into the observational shadow.
