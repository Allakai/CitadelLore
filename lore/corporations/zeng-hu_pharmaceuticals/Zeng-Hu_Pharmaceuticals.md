*"Injury is a simple fact of life, so when life is on the line, trust
Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals. From everyday accidents to life-threatening
injuries\*, our patented Tramadol (TM) formula and our powerful trauma
kits (containing DuraFlesh (TM), the most reliable\*\* emergency
nanite-based flesh sealant) will keep you and/or your employees calm,
cool, and collected until help arrives. \[...\]"*

*"Zeng-Hu doesn't just buy out corporations... it's more insidious than
that. They engulf them. They always ask nicely at first, but if that
doesn't work, they begin plotting, conspiring. First they cut off your
customers – suddenly, a huge shipment of your products disappears after
being seized by an overzealous border control agent, or you lose your
biggest customer after their board of directors decides they doesn't
want to deal with you anymore. Then, they cut off your suppliers. How
are you supposed to make a product when your production facilities don't
have power, or supplies, or air? And then, finally, what do they do?
They ask nicely again. And you know what? You always say yes."*  
— Anonymous former employee of Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals, on the company's
business strategies, 2559''

### Corporation History

Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals is one of the oldest [Trans-Stellar
Corporations](/wiki/Trans-Stellar_Corporations "wikilink") still in business
today, having been originally founded in the late 20th century as a
medical research facility located in mainland China. They received their
kick into success after the development of their patented mixture of
Tramadol, using the recently discovered Inaprovaline to vastly increase
its effects. But, don't let the name fool you – this company does more
than just pharmaceuticals. Zeng-Hu has been slowly growing in power over
the last five centuries as it slowly “established business
relationships” with its competitors, willingly or otherwise. From
cybernetics, to emergency injection systems, and even genetic
manipulation, Zeng-Hu dabbles in it all through various sub-departments,
puppet companies, and other varying false fronts. Using this modus
operandi, Zeng-Hu has managed to evade anti-trust laws established by
the [Free Trade Union](/wiki/Free_Trade_Union "wikilink"), and create a quite
literal business empire.

### Modern Day

The discovery of [phoron](phoron "wikilink") at the end of the 25th
century has lead to interesting developments for Zeng-Hu
Pharmaceuticals, most notably the rise of one of its greatest
competitors – [Nanotrasen](/wiki/Nanotrasen "wikilink"). The two companies
have fought tooth-and-nail over [phoron](phoron "wikilink") deposits,
due to the material's wide variety of uses in the medicinal field. While
Zeng-Hu has been staying out of [Tau Ceti](/wiki/Tau_Ceti "wikilink") for the
time being due to [Nanotrasen's](/wiki/Nanotrasen "wikilink") stranglehold on
the system, they have been making tentative steps towards
[Nyx](/wiki/Nyx "wikilink") as a potential center for their new
[phoron](phoron "wikilink") research projects. In the meantime, Zeng-Hu
continues to offer many diverse medicinal solutions for almost every
market. Even [Nanotrasen](/wiki/Nanotrasen "wikilink"), their biggest rivals,
use their patented pharmaceutical formulas, among other products, on
their stations and bases.
