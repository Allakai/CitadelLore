Overview
========

Biology
-------

![](Teshari.png "fig:Teshari.png") The Teshari are very small, rarely
reaching more than 3-4'/1-1.2m in height, and weigh less than
100lbs/45kg. They have rapid metabolisms and very efficient digestive
systems, and thanks to sharing in the medical technology of the
[Skrell](/wiki/Skrell "wikilink"), they tend to have robust and effective
immune systems. They lack sexual dimorphism between the sexs. They are
naturally adorn in earthen colors, However richer Teshari are known to
dye their feathers and skin.

They evolved for very cold and very barren areas, generally the polar
regions. Because of this, their skin is a fine insulator and many of
their internal processes are not particularly energy-efficient; they
cannot cope well at all with high temperatures.

Their hearing is exceptionally sensitive to the point that they can
detect a person moving on the other side of a wall, but comes at the
cost of being extremely vulnerable to sonic weaponry like flashbangs.

The Teshari are omnivorous but generally prefer to eat meat wherever
possible.

### Reproduction

A breeding pair of Teshari, generally supported by their social
grouping/pack, will lay a clutch of eggs and tend to them until they
hatch. The parenthood of the resulting children is generally irrelevant;
the entire pack is their family and protectors, although their blood
parents may have a status similar to that of an favorite uncle or aunt
in human culture. Depending on the culture of their society, as well as
how tied to the [Skrell](/wiki/Skrell "wikilink") they are, Teshari children
may enter the workforce as soon as they are old enough, be placed in
education, or take up a vocation.

Behavior
========

Relations
---------

-   **[Human](/wiki/Human "wikilink")**: Following a bumpy start after the
    Teshari representitive was mistaken for an exotic pet by the human
    representitive when the Skrell brought them to the galactic stage
    for the first time, the Teshari maintain decent relations with
    humanity.
-   **[Skrell](/wiki/Skrell "wikilink")**: The Teshari are a protectorate of
    the Skrell, maintaining excellent relations with the race that
    uplifted them.
-   **[Clown Planet](/wiki/Clown "wikilink")**: Extremely poor relations ever
    since the rubber chicken incident of 2551. Not a single teshari will
    elaborate on what exactly happened during the incident, so the
    situation that led to the name remains unknown.

Background
==========

Teshari centralized government consists of a grand parliament made up of
representitives from major teshari populations throughout the galaxy.
Originally, the [Skrell](/wiki/Skrell "wikilink") had a representitive to help
guide the government process and to prevent the teshari from making any
major mistakes, but in more recent times the Skrell's position has
become less active to the point of being honorary.

Culture
-------

Teshari culture is extremely social and open; privacy is not important
to most Teshari other than the most Skrell-integrated groups, and
communal activities like grooming, eating or watching entertainment are
part and parcel of Teshari life. A teshari pack tends to share a bedding
space, often sleeping in a communal pile as a method of conserving body
heat originally, but is continued as a social sign of trust in the pack.
Those Teshari who are able to leave the planet via spacecraft will
generally be more aware of the social expectations of other cultures,
especially if they have spent much time around Skrell in a social
setting.

Some Skrell cities, generally those bordering Teshari territory, may
have sections of the city inhabited by Teshari exclusively; this is
largely because standard Skrell construction and buildings are utterly
unsuitable for Teshari habitation. While each district tends to differ
in societal nature, these quarters tend to be open-aired and heavily
decorated, and due to the communal nature of the Teshari are often
treated as a single large dwelling.

Generally speaking, modern Teshari living in urban areas will find work
easily as hospitality staff, clerks, technicians, or any number of tasks
that require little heavy lifting. Many of them also work as personal
assistants and house staff for Skrell individuals or businesses,
although amongst the Teshari this is seen as rather demeaning as they
feel it leaves them being seen as a pet race. Teshari are also found in
more intellectual programs, often sponsored by or apprenticed to Skrell.

Technology
----------

Teshari rely heavily on the [Skrell](/wiki/Skrell "wikilink") for most of the
formal sciences, having easy access to their mentor race's knowledge
base. Most of the technology that they use is converted from Skrellian
technology, but teshari produced technologies are becoming increasingly
common.

Military
--------

The Teshari military is practically non-existent, relying on the
[Skrell](/wiki/Skrell "wikilink") for any situations that would require a
military presence. What they do have to help out, however, is the
Teshari [Auxiliary Spacefleet](/wiki/Auxiliary_Spacefleet "wikilink"), which
is dedicated to the more logistical aspects of the military, made up of
supply ships, ship tenders, hospital ships, and survey ships. The fleet
is mostly made from donated Skrellian ships, retrofitted for ease of use
for their Teshari crews, though the fleet is gradually adding Teshari
built ships.

The [TAS](/wiki/TAS "wikilink") only has two warships at present. The [TAS
Raptora Victore](/wiki/TAS_Raptora_Victore "wikilink"), a Teshari built
destroyer that serves as the flagship of the fleet, and the [TAS
Curiosity's Endeavor](/wiki/TAS_Curiosity's_Endeavor "wikilink"), a Teshari
built corvette used as a testing platform for experimental weaponry.
