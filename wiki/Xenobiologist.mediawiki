==== Xenobiology ====
This laboratory specializes in the the study of alien lifeforms, such as [[slime]]s and sometimes [[xenomorph]]s.

Careful handling and caution if this lab is advised as it is common for untrained personnel to inadvertently release the specimen. It is important to make sure your flock is fed, and any extra unneeded slimes culled to keep them from getting out of hand, it's also important to make sure adult slimes are fed enough to split, or they'll make a mess of their pens... Or you! Experiment on all sorts of fancy cores.

For more information, refer to the [[Guide to Xenobiology]]
