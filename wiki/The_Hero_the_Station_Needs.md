![In other words, if you want to be a hero, just do what you'd normally
do and don't lose your shit when things go
wrong.](hero.jpg "fig:In other words, if you want to be a hero, just do what you'd normally do and don't lose your shit when things go wrong.")
Unless [you are Baristo LeEnfant](/wiki/Beyond_the_impossible "wikilink"), one
cannot properly be this character. "The Hero the Station Needs," is a
term generally used to describe wannabe heroes. These "heroes" usually
end up getting in the way of security and/or emergency personal, and are
typically the first to die in an emergency situation, while possible
contributing to the death or general misfortune of the rest of the crew.
Don't try to be a hero. Leave it to the people whose job it actually is.

That doesn't mean you can't be a hero. The thing is, [most of the people
recognized as heroes](/wiki/Medals "wikilink") weren't actively trying to be
one. They were just doing what they normally do and remaining calm under
pressure. Do that, and you'll achieve great things and not look like a
[totally incompetent
clod](/wiki/Medals#Distinguished_Banner_of_Supreme_Ineptitude "wikilink") in
doing so.
