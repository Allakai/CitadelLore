Random events are separated by category and trigger at determined
intervals to keep the round fresh and interesting. There are three types
of random events: Mundane Events, Moderate Events, and Major Events.
Each of these three types is independent of the other two, which mean
that their timers are not intertwined. E.G: A major event occurring will
reset the next-event timer of the major events, but not the Moderate and
Mundane.

Mundane Events
--------------

### PDA Spam

Ever wondered how NanoTrasen makes all the cash needed to rebuild their
ever breaking stations? Maybe it's by letting small, washed up
businesses that feed on crew's stupidity spam their PDAs en masse at
random intervals of time. Even though ranked as a Mundane Event, most
crew agree that the onslaught of Spam is a major threat to sanity.

### Lottery Victory

One of the crewmembers on board the NSS Exodus won the lottery! Check
the closest [newscaster](newscaster "wikilink") to see if you're the
lucky person! Of course, NT will most likely confiscate the money for
Security reasons, but hey! You did win!

### Account Hacker

A bruteforce hack to one of the station accounts has been detected, a
warning has been issued on the Exodus messaging server. Quickly suspend
the account in question before you lose your hard-earned money!

### Mundane News

Did a celebrity die? Or did he release a new movie? Or was it both and
that cargo vessel crashed into a movie theater premiering said
celebrity's movie? Any and all news that the depressed crew most likely
doesn't care about will be coming to the
[newscasters](newscaster "wikilink") near you, today!

### Trivial News

What's better than Mundane News updates? Trivial news updates with
little to no information contained in the vaguest of headlines! Brought
to you by the Galaxy's finest reporter!

### Economic News

One of the only pieces of news relevant to the operation of the NSS
Exodus, these news, reported by the Nyx Daily; discuss the increase and
decrease of supply point prices of [supply
crates](supply_crates "wikilink"). Riots ongoing somewhere? See Security
crates from cargo skyrocket in price, while the sale value of minerals
goes down!

### Lost Carp

A bunch of space carp were on a field trip studying space, got separated
from their group, and got lost in the vastness of space. They decided
that their time would be better invested munching at the crewmembers of
the NSS Exodus, instead of panicking. 1 to 6 carp appear in this event.

### Brand Intelligence

Undoubtedly another way of NanoTrasen raking in extra revenue at the
expense of crew members, somehow a virus got installed on some vending
machines, making them wildly market their products, to the extent of
throwing them at unsuspecting passerbys, literally! Fix the affected
vendors, before it spreads to all of them.

### Vermin Infestation

The [Janitor](/wiki/Janitor "wikilink") was never good at his job. Which is
why, sometimes; spiderlings, mice, or lizards breed somewhere in the
station, wreaking havoc in the ranks of the germophobes.

### Wallrot

Once more, thanks to the general incompetence of the
[Janitor](/wiki/Janitor "wikilink"), some fungus-like substance is spreading
on the walls of the NSS Exodus and eating them inside out. Have
[Engineers](/wiki/Engineer "wikilink") fix it before the wall separating your
bathroom stall from your angry boss evaporates into thin air!

### Space Dust

A small cloud of space dust is headed toward the station, undoubtedly to
cause horrific minor damage to the station's exterior windows!

### Camera & APC Damage

The long years of 24/7 operation have taken their toll on some of the
camera and APC equipment on the station, causing them to break down and
stop functioning until an [Engineer](/wiki/Station_Engineer "wikilink") is
sent to rectify the issue.

Moderate Events
---------------

### Carp School

Rememeber those lost carp? Well, the rest of the field trip found them
and decided to make an unplanned adjustment to their schedule. It seems
NSS Exodus crew members are on the menu! 12 to 16 carp appear in this
event, in small groups; for remember, they're on a field trip!

### Rogue Drones

While NanoTrasen incessantly tries to rip you off and underpay you, they
never got around to upgrading their perimeter drones with the money they
saved. One of the drones patrolling the surrounding of the NSS Exodus is
malfunctioning, and is now rabidly hunting crewmembers to exterminate.
Hide behind [Security](/wiki/Security "wikilink") until Nanotrasen technical
teams finally get a lid on their toy.

### Meteor Shower

Assuming the [Chief Engineer](/wiki/Chief_Engineer "wikilink") didn't get the
meteor shield installed, then congratulations! Nanotrasen's excellent
and patent-pending autopilot system drove your station's orbital path
right into a meteor field! Assemble towards the center of the station,
the most likely impact zones.

### Communication Blackout

The random shrills of that annoying hormonal person in cargo itching
your ear all the time? Then this malfunction is for you! NanoTrasen's
perfect communication relays need a breather, and decided to stop
working mid-shift to go take their coffee break. Time to go back to
bounced radios, old school!

### Prison Break

Apparently, the architect behind the NSS Exodus spent a good time of his
life in prison, for he decided it were wise to make the doors leading
out of the [brig](brig "wikilink") as faulty and insecure as the
galaxy's politicians. Scramble to contain the prisoners as the doors
leading out of their new home bolt open. Time to scream at that AI
again...

### Grid Check

NanoTrasen is the light of our lives! Which is why they undertake random
and sporadic power grid checks, reminding the crew that without
NanoTrasen, there is no light. Deep, is it not?

### Electrical Storm

Stand and watch in awe as light tubes and bulbs explode into millions of
tiny pieces of glass, plunging you into darkness. Hassling the
[Janitor](/wiki/Janitor "wikilink") to come replace the broken light would be
a good idea at this point.

### Radiation Storm

The NanoTrasen autopilot system has showcased its superior abilities
once more! Scramble to sheltered maintenance shafts or dormitories to
escape the lethal rays now piercing the station at every level.

### Appendicitis

Something in the water on board this godforsaken facility is making your
intestines expand. It feels like something is about to burst out! Worry
not! It's just appendicitis! Rush over to medbay and undertake
[Surgery](/wiki/Guide_to_Surgery "wikilink") before you really die! It'll be a
pity surviving all the other adventures this company threw at you to die
in such an uneventful fashion!

### Viral Infection

Ok! Now you're sure there's something in this water! You can't stop
sneezing and coughing and twitching! The perfectly sanitized NSS Exodus
has arranged a meeting between you and a virus. Head over to a
[Virologist](/wiki/Virologist "wikilink") to find out more about this exciting
relationship!

### Spider Infestation

Remember those spiderlings that were breeding in the
[Vault](/wiki/Vault "wikilink") that no one cared about? Well, now they're
grown up and have families of their own! Did I mention they also have a
taste for blood? Call [Security](/wiki/Security "wikilink") and cower, as
usual.

### Ion Storm

Space is such a wonderful thing, isn't it? So wonderful that a simple
ion storm can alter the way the [AI](/wiki/AI "wikilink") on board this
station works. Expect the unexpected!

### Space Dust

A more severe cloud of space dust is on its way to the station. Expect
this more formidable cloud of dust to cause far more damage to the
station's hull than its mundane equivalent.

Major Events
------------

### Carp Invasion

Remember that Carp field trip that decided to visit you? Well, now their
parents are here, and very angry that you let them board the NSS Exodus
without consent forms. Angry carp everywhere! Too much to be counted!
Hide!

### Viral Outbreak

When unsanitary goes to pure filthy on-station, an extra-resilient and
extra-lethal virus rise out of the dirt and filth to plague the
crewmembers into quarantine-induced panic.

### Blob

One of the 'special' residents of our big great home that is Space,
Blobs know no obstacle and will make the station it's home if it wants
to. Well... No obstacles except fire.

### Meteor Wave

Venture into the thickest meteor belt the Nyx System has to offer! Cower
for your life in central areas of the station as explosions rock your
ear drums.

### Space Vines

Miss the firmness of earth, forest and jungle in the deepness of space?
Fret no more! Thanks to the baffling property-altering radiation of
space, vines not only now grow in space, but swallow and trap anything
that stands in their path. A battalion of scythe wielding
[Engineers](/wiki/Engineer "wikilink"), goats, or scientists will do just find
in showing the vines the customary NSS Exodus hospitality.
