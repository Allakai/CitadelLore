The **Cargo Technician's** role is, basically, to unload crates, load
the crates, make things in autolathe and mess with the MULE and mail
systems. Don't forget to monitor the [Disposals](/wiki/Disposals "wikilink")
area as well.

Your Workplace
--------------

The [Cargo Bay](/wiki/Cargo_Loading_Area "wikilink") is your home as a Cargo
Technician and, naturally, where you start the game. It contains a [Hand
Labeler](/wiki/Hand_Labeler "wikilink"), a [Cell
Charger](/wiki/Cell_Charger "wikilink") and [Power
Cell](/wiki/Power_Cell "wikilink") set, a [Station Bounced
Radio](/wiki/Station_Bounced_Radio "wikilink"), some [Rods](Rods "wikilink"),
a [Multitool](/wiki/Multitool "wikilink"), a [Med-kit](Med-kit "wikilink"),
some empty [Crates](/wiki/Crates "wikilink"), a
[MULE](/wiki/Quartermaster#MULEbot "wikilink"), a [Copy
Machine](/wiki/Copy_Machine "wikilink"), and an
[Autolathe](/wiki/Autolathe "wikilink").

Your Boss
---------

The [Head of Personnel](/wiki/Head_of_Personnel "wikilink") is your superior,
as is the [Quartermaster](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink"). Do what they order
you to do, with the [Head of Personnel](/wiki/Head_of_Personnel "wikilink")
being the top priority.

Disposals Mailing
-----------------

This is an alternative way of delivering items, and is usually
preferable to MULE transport as long as the pipes are still intact.

1.  Wrap your item/crate with package wrapper.
2.  Pick up the destination tagger and click in your hand to set a
    destination.
3.  Use the destination tagger on the parcel.
    -   Optional: Use a pen to write a message on the parcel, or custom
        set a destination.)
4.  Stick it on the conveyor, or dump it in a disposals unit, and let
    the system handle it.
    -   Tip: Click and drag the large parcels to disposals units to put
        them in. This can only be done a few times however.

You can also gift wrap packages, but these cannot be tagged with a
destination, and have to be delivered manually. This will not work with
large objects. The process is slightly more complicated.

1.  Pick up the item you want to gift wrap.
2.  Hold a sharp object in your other hand. (Wirecutters are the most
    common for this.)
3.  Click the wrapping paper with the item you want to wrap.

Gift wrapping a human is also possible, but they must have a straight
jacket on and you need the wrapping paper in your hand. This is usually
not a good idea.

Using the MULEBot
-----------------

1.  Drag the crate on to the MULE.
2.  Set a destination with your PDA or on the control panel.
3.  Send the MULE off!

How to Recharge the MULEBot
---------------------------

1.  Open up the maintenance panel with a screwdriver. (Make sure the
    controls are unlocked first!)
2.  Take out the power cell. (Top entry.)
3.  Insert charged power cell.
4.  Close panel with screwdriver.

Traitoring
----------

You're a bit of in a pickle here, but wait. There's an
[autolathe](autolathe "wikilink") that can help you GREATLY. You can
also order a lot of stuff, but [opening
them](/wiki/Syndicate_Items#Electromagnetic_Card "wikilink") is a different
matter. Be careful though, if there is a Quartermaster, he will probably
notice your shady activities in the Cargo Bay.
