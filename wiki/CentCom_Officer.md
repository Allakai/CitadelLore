You are in the direct service of [Virgo Prime Central
Command](/wiki/Nanotrasen "wikilink"). As a **CentCom Officer**, your job may
vary with whatever is currently needed, but is generally to help your
[assigned station](/wiki/Virgo_Orbital_Research_Establishment "wikilink") by
either directly observing day-to-day affairs, or conducting covert
investigations against staff members with a record of poor conduct.

Sometimes you'll also do fun things like organize parties for VIP
visits, or hand out [Medals](/wiki/Medals "wikilink"), but in any case you're
there to be a tool of the company's administration.

The Boss's Boss
---------------

You outrank **everyone** on the station. This is both a blessing and a
curse.

On the one hand, you outrank [Colony
Directors](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink"), [Emergency Response
Teams](/wiki/Emergency_Response_Team "wikilink"), and even [Asset
Protection](/wiki/Asset_Protection "wikilink") must bend to your whim
(although they won't like it). Your only equals are other CentCom
Officers, and your only direct superiors are higher ranked individuals
at CentCom its self, such as the [the CentCom Chief
Officers](/wiki/Chain_of_Command#CentCom "wikilink").

On the other hand, *because* you outrank literally everyone, if you
abuse this, you will make a lot of people not want to do their job
because somebody higher up is available to blame when things go wrong.
You will also be the first person people will complain to because most
crew don't understand how to follow the [Chain of
Command](/wiki/Chain_of_Command "wikilink"), so they will automatically skip
to the highest ranked person around to fix all of their tedious
problems.

As such, the reason CentCom doesn't deploy its CentCom officers
regularly to the station crew is because it actually severely hampers
productivity. So long as you are present though, you have a strict
policy that you are expected to follow.

Contacting Central Command
--------------------------

Anyone can contact Central Command at any time by using a simple fax
machine. Some heads of staff also have access to an emergency
transponder in the command console for incidents that require live
support, but if a CentCom officer isn't actively listening to the
station's comms, this may go unheard.

Fax is the best way to get into contact for something that's new, the
emergency transponder is best for things that are ongoing.

Note, faxes are also sent to the admin channel on Discord. Even if no
admins are online, we can still read faxes. Think of it as an in
character admin-help button.

Your Equipment
--------------

You get a CentCom PDA, a CentCom ID with **all access to *everything the
company owns*, including CentCom its self**, a CentCom headset with
access to all company radio channels including ERT, and a spiffy CentCom
uniform.

However, remember that the pen is mightier than the energy sword. Write
down anything worth noting and keep it with you until you can fax your
superiors back at Central Command, or take the documents home with you
by yourself. You also may occasionally be equipped with a weapon for
self defense but this is usually at the preference of individual
observers. (For admins, that means you get to ass-spawn ONE weapon when
you arrive. Make it count, but be reasonable.)

Non-Interference Policy
-----------------------

When you come to the station as a Central Command Officer, you follow a
strict Non-Interference Policy. As such, unless whatever you are dealing
with pertains directly to the purpose of your visit, you are not to
interfere with *anything* that is happening, no matter how badly things
are going wrong. By interfering, you take responsibility for a crisis
upon yourself, while the people who normally should have been
responsible now can't be fairly punished for their negligence because
you got in the way.

Your job **is not** to just sit around all day and have people come to
complain at you. If that is what you wanted to spend your work day
doing, you should just stay at CentCom and wait for an [Internal Affairs
Agent](/wiki/Internal_Affairs_Agent "wikilink") to fax you. Instead, your
presence on the station should have a predefined purpose, and a set
goal.

Here are some of the things you might do as a CentCom Officer:

-   Aid in the transfer of high value prisoners from NanoTrasen to the
    [USDF](/wiki/USDF "wikilink"), such as terrorists, or pirates.
-   Greet VIPs who are visiting the station.
-   Instruction seminars for the crew.
-   Oversee executions.
-   Perform safety inspections of the station.
-   Punish head of staffs like the Colony Director, up to and including
    termination of employment.
-   Serve as a neutral mediator between ambassadors of
    [SolGov](/wiki/SolGov "wikilink") and any alien civilizations that might
    exist on the edge of the galactic frontier.
-   <s>Taste testing the crew.</s>
-   Testing and/or distribution of new standard equipment.
-   Etc.

The Thin Metagaming Line
------------------------

A CentCom Officer is usually an admin's way of dealing with in-character
disputes that should <u>stay</u> in-character. However, *because* you
are in-character, the character doesn't necessarily know everything you
know OOCly, such as attack logs, things people said, etc. Unlike an
admin, the CentCom officer **doesn't** have access to server logs, so
they must find evidence on their own. As a result, they might make
mistakes, play favorites, be bias, fail to find the bad guy, etc...
Ideally you should never be banned for something that was only
in-character. If you broke *actual server [Rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink")*,
the admins wouldn't bother using a CentCom officer to tell you so. They
would just sent a private message to scold you, or [ban
you](/wiki/Guide_to_Avoiding_Bans "wikilink").

If a CentCom Officer is how the admins choose to deal with something,
then rejoice, because it probably means nobody is getting banned right
now because whatever went wrong was still interesting enough to warrant
the plot not being disrupted. Keep in mind, pissing off a CentCom
Officer might still result in [other
consequences](/wiki/Permanent_Death "wikilink"), so just because you're not
going to be banned doesn't mean you should be an asshole.

**This is the only time admins on Vorestation are allowed to play
favorites** or have biases, but as with all things, if you think this
privilege is being abused, you should contact other admins to express
your disapproval. The only reason this is allowed is because nepotism in
the work place is something that happens in real life, so it's
interesting to emulate this conflict of interests in the story
environment.
