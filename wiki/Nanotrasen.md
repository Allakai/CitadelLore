"When man first looked up to the stars, he saw god. When man looked up
to the stars again, he saw greatness. When man looked up to the stars a
third time, he saw truth. When man rose to meet those stars, he found
emptiness. No gods, no greatness, no truth, nothing. The universe turned
out to be devoid of the meaning man had desperately sought.
Breakthroughs in FTL travel decades ago allowed mankind to branch out to
the stars, colonising as many planets, moons, and asteroids we could
find. Advances in engineering have granted the ability to inhabit
anything from lush, earth-like worlds to the cold clutches of space
itself. Though first united under the idealistic Union of Humanity,
dissent grew and the union fractured into numerous groups: The
Federation of Sirius, New Terra, and a number of independent systems.
Perhaps more powerful than these new governments, the great
trans-stellar corporations arose - [NanoTrasen](/wiki/NanoTrasen "wikilink"),
Ward-Takahashi, Aether Atmospherics, and the like. Multibillion thaler
corporations quickly wrested their way onto the interstellar stage; even
inter-system law couldn't fully control them. Today, it doesn't matter
where you're from, but who you work for: your employer is your king and
you are but another pawn in the noble quest for profit.

While barren, our universe had some surprise in store - wondrous events
were realised, great discoveries were made, and humanity's repository of
knowledge grew. By far the greatest discovery, however, was made in the
hitherto unexplored (and mostly unheard-of) system called [Gliese
229](/wiki/Nyx "wikilink"). [Gliese 229B](Nyx#Erebus "wikilink"), a class 'T'
brown dwarf star (since reclassified as a 'phoron giant'), was
discovered to contain a significant amount of a unique and unstable
compound â€“ dubbed "phoron" by the crew of the MITSV Venchenlitte-1, a
survey vessel sent out by the Martian Science Institute in 2492 - which
granted humanity into new realms of power generation. Corporations
everywhere sought to secure the dwarf and unlock its secrets; the
conflict over this unknown compound became a new kind of hell. One such
trans-stellar made a name for itself overnight - NanoTrasen
Incorporated, formerly a medical conglomerate - as the most ruthless to
get involved in the bloody conflict, outright assaulting assets of the
competition. Since Sol Central stepped in and ended the conflict,
NanoTrasen has retained the reputation of being the fiercest
trans-stellar in the phoron industry, performing a majority of their
extraction operations from the atmosphere of Erebus proper. While other
corporations and trans-stellars mine the ring systems - due to a marked
abundance of semi-stable phoron compounds - several perform extraction
from the phoron giant in direct competition with the mad dog,
NanoTrasen. Cutting corners and competitors, the NanoTrasen name echoes
through the vastness of space as the very manifest of mankind's worst
sins - Avarice, Gluttony, Wrath, Pride."

About
-----

### Corporation History

NanoTrasen Systems Incorporated started out as a small company, whose
research was mostly based around gene-therapy in the heart of human
space, Mars. This was shortly prior to the series of scandals over
cloning being reserved to the rich rather than being provided to
industrialist fodder in the most prosperous part of Sol - NanoTrasen was
effective at patenting methods that lead to more cost effective coverage
plans for business use, primarily through aggressive business tactics
than personal research brilliance- Many minor bio/med research
facilities ended up on the unpleasant end of Xavier Trasen's desire to
make a name for himself and sharklike approach, and were bought out and
taken apart for his company's capitalization. By the end of the decade,
NanoTrasen became a trans-stellar entity.

At the turning point of the 26th Century, Plasma was discovered.
NanoTrasen and its competitors were, naturally, the foremost
corporations in attempting to exploit this valuable new resource, and
they all set up numerous stations and factories around the Plasma Giants
in order to exploit the resource. This only jump-started the economy,
and the so-called Orange Rush began, with all of the corporations
attempting to find as many uses of the valuable Plasma as possible in
order to profit the most from the human governments. Research
facilities, stations, ships and other installations were being
manufactured faster than ever. NanoTrasen was one of the more
bloodthirsty corporations, and managed to bankrupt and absorb many other
companies on a larger scale that ever before. Many feel NanoTrasen's
only defining ability is in capitalizing upon other's hard work- And not
an entirely untrue assumption. Nonetheless, this only further increased
NanoTrasen's power and scope, ratcheting it up to the status of a true
super-corporation, one of the top 10 most expansive business empires in
the galaxy.

### Modern Day

NanoTrasen is one of the big super-corporations in the modern day. It
deals in research of the most advanced sciences, such as genetics,
[bluespace](bluespace "wikilink"), and - recently - the uses of plasma.
They also have a sizeable asset protection and security branch with
which they secure both investments and occasionally new acquisitions - a
distressing rival to some minor star systems, and a powerful
administrative branch sitting atop it all, directing their company's
actions. NanoTrasen is characterized by its aggression and questionable
ethics, which, combined with the high emphasis they put on new, untested
and dangerous technology, means their installations are often considered
unsafe and hazardous.

To a degree few of its competitors could achieve, NanoTrasen owes its
success to diversity and quick reactions to unfolding events aboard its
starships. Worth a distinct laugh to employees who are told of this,
NanoTrasen's fluidity and aggression tactics are still considered the
core of its success. While most facilities get their personnel already
prepared for specific roles, among the stars situation often changes
quickly and drastically - far faster than a flight of a shuttle from the
nearest NanoTrasen's station takes - and so the choice of assignments is
up to the commanding officers (especially - Head of Personnel) depending
on the most urgent needs at the moment. NanoTrasen hires almost anyone
possessing a skill in areas such as science, medicine or
space-engineering and every contracted worker after passing a couple of
basic tests can hope for a good pay in space, especially if sent to an
important installation.

NanoTrasen hiring process is often flimsy in sorting out industrial
spies, as a result of this simple hiring process, often instead keeping
orders on high to make the best of having even rival talent or tattlers
on payroll - a reality in the modern day - using the best of loopholes
to ensure from an entry level position, it would be impossible, although
sorely testing, to find the launch for a lawsuit or get away with real
assets. Often experts skilled in almost any area areas such as detective
work, cooking or sanitation also find their place on NanoTrasen's
payroll and onboard corporation's ships for support.

NanoTrasen's history and policies give a paradoxical reputation as both
a life ruiner and one of the best second chances many people will get.

### Classifications

NanoTrasen ships vary from research vessels to military-grade patrol
ships. Stations vary from industrial complexes to weapons platforms.

-   NS\* = NanoTrasen Science. The bread and butter of NanoTrasen's
    industry, this classification, while second in number to the sheet
    swarm of transports, is primary what the company is about,
    furthering their everyday profit margins.
-   NT\* = NanoTrasen Transport. Cargo, holding, supply, passenger
    ships- All are filed under transport, and do the grunt work in
    swarms for the company
-   ND\* = NanoTrasen Defense. A class licensed for varying levels of
    hard weaponry- Considered primarily for asset protection.
-   NR\* = NanoTrasen Response. These can vary from communications to
    medical care, acting as support to other parts of the corporation,
    that other ships don't quite fall under... Or occasionally do, under
    a different guise.
-   NA\* = NanoTrasen Administration. These tend to be central bases,
    and are almost never ships with notable exceptions being
    semi-personal vessels of the CEO, Board of Directors, and similar
    entities.
-   NB\* = NanoTrasen Business. Sales, marketing, product delivery, and
    other commercial services. These tend to be almost exclusively bases
    or, more rarely, stations. They handle the actual movement of money,
    PR, and other such fun affects of the company.
-   NI\* = NanoTrasen Industrial. These are almost never mobile ships,
    as they are heavy duty production hubs that deal in the obtaining
    and production of goods for sale, such as refined phoron gas,
    electronics, weapons, toothpaste, or other goods.
-   N\*S = Station. The fun things floating in space that don't tend to
    go places.
-   N\*V = Vessel. Spaceships and similarly travelling crafts.
-   N\*B = Base. These tend to refer to grounded installations of all
    varieties, including planetside colonies, moon bases, and asteroid
    outposts.

-   [NSB Adephagia](/wiki/Virgo_Orbital_Research_Establishment "wikilink");
    the official, seldom-used moniker of the V.O.R.E. tether on
    Virgo-3B.

Rankings
--------

For the most part, down from the executive portion of the company,
determining one's superiors is relatively straightforward.

-   An administrative station/base is assigned to a system/region under
    a [Chief Administration
    Officer](/wiki/Chain_of_Command#CentCom "wikilink") by the company's
    [Chief Operations
    Officer](/wiki/Chain_of_Command#Corporate_Executives "wikilink").
-   The CAO appoints several Chiefs of Staff, which are then followed by
    specific agents under those departments, along with day to day
    operations staff as per a normal location.
-   A *Director of Operations* such as a Captain or [Colony
    Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink") is assigned to the location by
    the Administrative Human Resources Director, and an advisory
    internal affairs agent is assigned by the *Chief of Social
    Resources*.
-   *Heads of Staff* are assigned for the distinct departments and/or
    administrative duties by HR under the Captain/DoO.
    -   Individual departments occasionally have delegations of command,
        such as [Quartermasters](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink") and
        [Wardens](/wiki/Warden "wikilink") regarding specific departmental
        instances.
-   *Department staff* manage their specialties.
-   Interns such as [Assistants](/wiki/Assistants "wikilink") are assigned to
    stations for learning opportunities.

the [Chain of Command](/wiki/Chain_of_Command "wikilink").

### Central Specific Departments

Post shift, some workers have contracts which allow them stay at the NAB
Zeus, providing them with lodgings and civilian center level comforts on
auxiliary parts of the station exclusive to company employees. Some
choose to take bluespace transport shuttles to nearby systems or back to
Sol on an express link line. Nonetheless, most paper pushers and all
Heads of Staff spend at least some ostensible 'off shift' hours enjoying
the hospitality of CentCom as they work out their station's issues and
report success to their superiors. The following are administrative
departments found there.

#### Social Resources

Formerly known as Human Resources: These guys who decide if you get a
paycheck, and they also read most of the faxes directed to CentCom.
After each shift, most administrative staff of the check in and out with
the Social Resources department. Social Resources coordinates heavily
with Accounting and Internal Affairs in order to ensure their people are
generating a profit and aren't causing a loss. Social Resources has two
primary agents: Investigators, and Auditors.

**Investigators** are bad news to have show up, usually called in by
Internal Affairs when a grievous error is made by ranking staff. They
ensure productivity isn't impaired by rampant stupidity. A legal Human
Resources Investigator must have a *permit of operations* signed by the
Social Resources Department, and valid for the ship/station/base they
are investigating, and a valid and up to date identification card from
their administrative station/base. They have the authority to strip any
crew of rank for the duration of a shift, and hold it suspended until
audit.

**Auditors** carry the dread their name implies. When a complaint is
filed against a crew member, auditors are the individuals who carry out
the interrogations(audits) of the employee in person if IA cannot,
submitting their personal suggestion to the Social Resources Department
regarding an employee's continued paycheck gathering after reviewing the
math from Accounting and a fully compiled case from Internal Affairs.
These individuals also conduct annual audits for general purposes as
well. They are effectively secretaries for the Social Resources
Department, but highly respected ones.

#### Internal Affairs

Internal Affairs is the legal crew employed by NanoTrasen. Generally
appointed for their discretionary ability, discreet management of
lawsuits and various miscellany falls under. Suits and snitches, what
the region's Head of Internal Affairs does with its cases to make ends
meet is the business of the Chief Administration Officer, the Corporate
Executives, and occasionally [Sol](/wiki/Sol "wikilink"). Internal Affairs
rarely takes direct involvement or authority over situations and cases,
preferring to hand off official decision making and judgement to its
fellows. Its agents are the same, acting in an 'advisory' fashion on
their assignments. Given that their work affects one's record and
ability to obtain legal assistance from the company, it is best to stay
on their good side.

#### Accounting

Accounting is the mathematical, cold, unfeeling, paycheck-making part of
the company that keeps any big mega-corporation moving; with money.
Accounting sets the bars and lays out what goals need met and where the
company stands. Suffice to say, most other parts of the company are
forced to take Accounting seriously, or be at risk in their own jobs.
Social Resources and Accounting tend to be joined at the hip in most
systems and sectors, as their work often impacts the choices of the
other, and accounting ordinarily chokes Asset Protection's chain when
they start chomping at the bit.

#### [Asset Protection](/wiki/Asset_Protection "wikilink")

Also known as the [NanoTrasen Defense
Force](/wiki/NanoTrasen_Defense_Force "wikilink"), Asset Protection is the
administrative answer to security. This department is responsible to
protect all holdings in the Chief Administration Officer's region from
any crisis or emergency. The NDF commands all ND\* assets, manages
response teams, and keeps records clean so that other military groups
(like the [USDF](/wiki/USDF "wikilink")) don't have to come pick up the slack
that basic [Security Officers](/wiki/Security_Officer "wikilink") can't
handle.
