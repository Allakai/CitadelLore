As you may have fathomed, this server has several... notable differences
with other SS13 communities, even heavy-RP servers like Baystation. If
you're used to playing on other servers, you should bear these points in
mind or you might end up tripping over things.

WE EAT PEOPLE.
--------------

Yeah. Let's get that out of the way right off the bat.

That's not to say that everyone here is explicitly in it for all vore,
all the time, but if you're freaked out by the fact that it happens,
then you may want to look elsewhere for your 2D spacemans fix.

We have ongoing continuity.
---------------------------

Unlike most servers, the roleplay is *constant*. As in, there's no reset
at the end of the shift, there are very rarely any retcons and anything
that happens in a previous round is considered "canon" in subsequent
rounds. And yes, **the end of the round after the shuttle docks is
in-character too, so no end-of-round grief-fests or killing sprees.**
The upshot of this is that you *can* have a long ongoing RP with another
player that spans several shifts, weeks, or even months. Which leads us
neatly onto...

We have story arcs.
-------------------

You know the events on the lore page? Details like [Operation
Magnum](/wiki/Operation_Magnum "wikilink") , the
[Redspace](/wiki/Redspace "wikilink") invasion and the [Cult of Devoratrix
Mundi](/wiki/Cult_of_Devoratrix_Mundi "wikilink"), The [Last Flight of the
Calypso](/wiki/Last_Flight_of_the_Calypso "wikilink"), not to mention the
[Space Nazis](/wiki/Space_Nazis "wikilink")? These are all plotlines and
events that spanned weeks or months, or are still ongoing at the time of
writing - while we may not have the usual secret traitors hidden among
the crew, other events are happening to keep the crew on their toes. We
even have a few players that *aren't even into vore* who come here to
take part in these events, many of which involve the
[Gateway](/wiki/Gateway "wikilink") and large PvE excursions.

We are an extended-mode server.
-------------------------------

That means, don't expect antagonists to be showing up on a regular
basis. We still have them occasionally, either by spawning them in or
giving a crew member some objectives to complete, but validhunters
looking for some tators to dunk are in for a bad time (and will probably
get arrested by security for packing contraband weaponry). That's not to
say you shouldn't be on your toes around potential predators, though.
The difference is, when it comes to eating, *anyone* can be a hazard to
the rest of the crew. Or, well, kidnap them safely if that's their
thing. The key point is, on most rounds, nobody is an antag. On the
other hand, in a way, *everyone* is.

Antag-knowledge isn't assumed to be automatic.
----------------------------------------------

With us being an extended, continuous roleplay, there are certain
stylistic differences when it comes to what characters are assumed to
know. Generally speaking, knowledge of the inner workings of hostile
organisations such as the [Syndicate](/wiki/Syndicate "wikilink") is limited
to things that the characters in question have *personally* experienced
- there are some slight exceptions, a
[xenobiologist](xenobiologist "wikilink") is likely to know a little
more about xenomorphs than most crewmembers, for instance, who are
generally aware that xenos are a thing but not much more than that.
Unless, of course, they've met one - or at least been told about them
in-character.

Coming in with a new character and immediately blurting out in-character
knowledge of stuff they shouldn't have any IC way of knowing is liable
to get you slapped for metagaming. One memorable incident was a newly
joined character telling other crewmembers in the bar about this
horrible creature called a "changeling" and going into great detail
about what changelings are and what they're capable of, when we hadn't
had a changeling on the server, like, ever. (okay, one time we used a
changeling with the Mimic Voice ability as a placeholder "alien
creature" for a mini-event but that's about it. They can't even change
appearance in the buggy version of Baycode we use *which kinda defeats
the point of being a changeling.*)
