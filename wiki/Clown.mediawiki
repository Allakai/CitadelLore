== Overview ==
Not much is known about this occupation, as <s>no one's allowed to play the fucking job</s> it is shrouded in mystery. What little is known about the clown, is that they wear a mask, a silly outfit, and shoes that don't fit, and <s>get gurgled for slipping someone with a banana peel</s> play harmless pranks on their crew members. The tradition of clownery dates back hundreds of years, to <s>a secret alien race of clown people, hailing from the forbidden clown planet "Big Top"</s> ancient Sol tradition.

==Clown Traditions==
Clowns have traditional rituals, that, while not confirmed by actual documented data, have been passed down by word of mouth. The clown, as per a nonverbal agreement, has the permission to <s>act like they have brain damage</s> do things that would land a normal crew member in the Psychiatrist's office, or worse, the Brig. These include, but are not limited to: hiding your identity, <s>being a greytiding little piece of</s> acquiring tools they don't really need, and using them for [[Hacking]] into places that don't come with their occupation, and <s> annoying everyone </s> playing pranks on their fellow crew, using tools such as, the slippery skin of the banana, the horn from a bicycle, and many other things.
