The Mission
-----------

Security's main goal is to enforce peace and order and to attempt to be
mediators between crew when there is a conflict. It is **not**
necessarily to arrest and fine people for every little infraction. Use
your judgement. Arresting someone should be a last resort, not your
first move. Obviously the more serious the crime is, the less likely it
can be handled by anything short of an arrest. However if you're
brigging people for calling you a jerk over the radio, or starting a man
hunt over some graffiti, you're not only doing your job wrong, you're
also probably going to get job banned. You're a peace keeper. Not the
[Gestapo](/wiki/Shitcurity "wikilink").

The Hierarchy
-------------

The [Head of Security](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink") holds authority over
the entire department.

The [Warden](/wiki/Warden "wikilink") holds authority over the brig and the
armory. They can authorize equipment and order officers within the Brig,
unless otherwise overridden by the Head of Security. The Warden is also
responsible for the upkeep and treatment of prisoners, an is responsible
for their well-being, injury, or death, even if caused by other
officers.

In short: The HoS is in charge if you're on patrol, but if you're
hanging out in Security, the Warden gets to boss you around as well.

The Equipment
-------------

See [Security Items](/wiki/Security_Items "wikilink") and [Standard Operating
Procedure](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure#Standard_Security_Gear "wikilink")
for details.

Be reasonable about what gear you’re carrying. Carrying more than the
necessary amount of gear specified in SoP not only scares the crew, but
it also presents a risk of that gear being stolen should you be caught
off guard.

Furthermore, don’t overreact to an incident, and don’t over-arm yourself
either. The longer you take gearing up, the more time a criminal has to
prepare themselves for your response. Your normal officer gear can
handle the vast majority of threats you will encounter. Even a taser’s
voltage, while non-lethal to humanoids, can often kill most wild animals
who might harm the crew. You shouldn’t need additional or specialized
gear unless there are multiple threats working together, or the threat
is known to be heavily armed. Remember again that your gear can be
stolen if you fall in combat.

Law
---

[Corporate Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") is a summary
of most crimes with some suggested sentence times. The [Colony
Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink") is sometimes able to set his own
guidelines in exceptional circumstances, such as [code
red](code_red "wikilink") emergencies and station-wide threats.

Standard Procedure
------------------

Much of Security's guide has been moved to [Standard Operating
Procedure](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure#Security "wikilink") for
reference by all crew. The following is only relevant to Security
personnel.

### Responding to Calls

If someone calls for security, an officer should respond ASAP. Having
another officer use the cameras to check the area is also recommended.
Additional officers should be dispatched as needed.

Upon arriving at the scene, the first responder is expected to gauge the
exact nature at the scene.

If the scene is clear:

-   Radio in the situation at the scene.
-   Ensure the safety of any crew in the immediate vicinity.
-   Identify witnesses.
-   Secure the scene in the event of occurrences (tape off area/disallow
    witness to leave).
-   Proceed to [collecting
    evidence](/wiki/Guide_to_Security#Collecting_Evidence "wikilink").

If the scene is not clear:

-   Identify nature of threat. Follow the rules of engagement as
    specified in [Standard Operating
    Procedure](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure#Rules_of_Engagement "wikilink").
-   If threat is able to be handled by officers on scene: Proceed with
    mediation/detainment.
-   If threat is unable to be handled by officers on scene: Request
    immediate assistance. Upon requesting assistance, await said
    assistance before proceeding. Ensure your safety before ensuring the
    safety of others on scene.

### Collecting Evidence

-   Crime scenes must be sealed off for evidence to be valid. Ensure
    non-security personnel do not enter the scene. Avoid cordoning off
    high-traffic areas unless a serious crime (such as murder or mutiny)
    has been committed. Permission from the relevant head of staff, head
    of security, or captain should be gained to cordon off high-traffic
    areas of specific departments.
-   If possible, cordoned off areas should still allow access around it,
    via maintenance tunnels, less area taped off, or other methods.
-   Autopsies are secondary to cloning of non-criminal employee bodies.
    Autopsies should be performed within the morgue after cloning
    attempts have been made.
-   Disrupt standard station operation as little as possible around the
    crime scene.
-   Investigative staff (Detective/Forensics) should be requested.
    Officers on scene are expected to ensure scene security until/during
    the arrival of/processing of the scene by investigative staff. If no
    investigative staff is available, officers are expected to secure
    evidence on scene.
-   Witness statements should be taken (either via recorder or on paper)
    and physical evidence should be secured.

### Handling Evidence

-   Ensure gloves are worn to prevent contamination of evidence.
-   Items that can be, must be held in evidence bags for transportation.
-   Crime scene must be preserved until all evidence is collected.
-   After evidence is collected, cadavers may be removed to the morgue
    and area may be cleaned up.

### Arrest

Proceed as follows during the event of detainment:

-   Follow the [rules of
    engagement](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure#Rules_of_Engagement "wikilink")
    as always.
-   If responding to more than a minor crime, attempt to get at least
    one officer to back you up in case of resisting. No more unless
    necessary.
-   Request the suspect surrender peaceably.
-   If suspect complies, escort them to <s>your stomach</s> the brig for
    [processing](/wiki/Guide_to_Security#Processing "wikilink"). Handcuffs are
    not required for minor crimes.
-   If suspect refuses, attempt to handcuff. Verbal disagreement or
    swearing is not considered resisting arrest. Actual threats however
    are covered by other laws.
-   If suspect continues to resist, such as fighting back or running
    away, apply necessary force to neutralize and detain the suspect. A
    charge of resisting arrest should be applied in this case, as per
    [Corporate Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") §202.
-   <s>If you have no handcuffs, eat them.</s>
-   Bring the suspect to the brig for <s>digestion</s> [criminal
    processing](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure#Criminal_Processing "wikilink").

### Processing, Questioning, Jailing, and Release

These sections have been moved to [Criminal Processing under Security's
Standard Operating
Procedure](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure#Criminal_Processing "wikilink").

### Permanent Holding

-   Bring the prisoner to <s>your stomach</s> Prison Processing Area as
    you normally would.
-   Have the prisoner remove all items barring no-access Identification
    Cards, PDAs, and Radio Headsets. Ensure all cartridges/chips are
    removed from radios/PDAs. In the event that prisoner is
    uncooperative or cannot be allowed out of handcuffs without threat
    to officers' well being, additional officers should assist the
    prisoner in assuming the proper garb.
-   Transfer prisoner into permanent <s>body fat</s> holding.
-   The prisoner's superior (Head of Staff) should be informed of their
    status.

Note: Prisoners moved into permanent holding should be checked on
regularly.

Security controlled locations
-----------------------------

![Security and armory](SecurityandArmory.png "fig:Security and armory")
<s>**[Arrivals Checkpoint](/wiki/Arrivals_Checkpoint "wikilink"):** This
checkpoint is near the arrival shuttle. It has an ID computer which the
HoP can man as well as other security computers. There is also a locker
with security gear. Late-joining security officers might find it to be a
good idea to take the equipment from here.</s> This is outdated.

**[The Brig](/wiki/Brig "wikilink"):** The Warden runs this area. He has
authority over Security Officers within this area. The Brig itself has
cells and cell timers.

**[Security Office and Armory](/wiki/Security_and_Armory "wikilink"):**
Security's home base. The armory contains additional weapons and armor
which the HoS and Warden have access to. They should hand out this
additional equipment as the situation escalates aboard the station. The
security lockers with equipment are found here as well as the Head of
Security's Office and the Briefing Room/Lounge. Within the Briefing
Room/Lounge is a SECTech machine. Contained within are several pieces of
equipment useful to security officers (flashes, flash bangs, handcuffs,
evidence bag boxes, and doughnuts).

The Escape Shuttle
------------------

In the event that a shuttle is en route (either transfer or escape),
your job will be to ensure that everyone, including prisoners, proceeds
to the shuttle in an orderly fashion. No foul play. Any dangerous
behavior should be treated as such. Prisoners in the brig should only be
held in the security area of the shuttle.

Other good tips
---------------

-   Application of force is often not the only solution to an issue.
    Lethal force should also only be pursued if all other routes fail
    <s>or they squirm in your belly too much</s>.
-   Minimal force should be used at all appropriate times, but not at
    the risk of your own life.
-   Apply escalating force as deemed necessary by suspect's actions.
    Minimal force as required by a situation should be applied.
-   You should not remove your headset, even if taking a break, as an
    emergency could begin at any time. If you are on break, let your
    superiors know.
-   Don't play with contraband. Just because you're security doesn't
    mean other security won't arrest you for using contraband.
-   If you see other security abusing contraband, arrest them and tell
    the HoS so they get fired.
-   When reporting your location, be specific. Screaming, "AAAHH HELP"
    doesn't actually result in help.
-   Yelling over comms, yelling in general, typing allcaps on an angry
    PDA message, threatening people, or displaying other psychotic
    behaviors is very bad for Security, as it makes the crew hate you by
    default.
-   Stay sober. Not only does getting drunk on duty look bad, but you
    also happen to carry weapons on you. People aren’t comfortable when
    you’re intoxicated and carrying weapons.
-   Other unprofessional behavior is usually bad. Avoid looking
    unprofessional or mentally unstable.
-   Mingle with the crew. They'll like you more and possibly be helpful
    as informants.
-   Unless you’re on prisoner guard duty, the warden is never your boss.
    They are not a second in command to the Head of Security. If the HoS
    goes missing, the warden does not suddenly become the new HoS. The
    Colony Director is to handle the responsibilities of the HoS in the
    absence of a proper one. If the warden tries to enforce otherwise,
    arrest them for [Exceeding Official
    Powers](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations#Medium_Level_Infractions "wikilink")
    (§214).
-   There's no such thing as 'Acting HoS'. Either there is an HoS, or
    there isn't. There is no 'Acting'.
-   If the Colony Director is trying to order Security around despite
    there being an HoS active on station, the HoS's lawful orders take
    preference. The Colony Director is *supposed* to give their orders
    through them, but that is not happening, then communications are
    already breaking down. It's best to limit the damage of
    miscommunications by agreeing to listen to the HoS by default.
-   Security has no authority over civilians other than Corporate
    Regulations. You cannot legally enforce any other orders on the crew
    under normal circumstances. If you try enforcing SoP on Cargo for
    example, you're going to be laughed at and probably fired.
-   When questioning anyone, be they witness or suspect, or even other
    Security, be sure to listen to all sides with an unbiased ear. Just
    because something isn't true doesn't mean someone was intentionally
    lying. If you are being told something you know not to be true, then
    there's a reason they are doing that, and you have to find out why.
-   Do not needlessly escalate situations; you should be working to
    *defuse* any potential hostile situation rather than resort to your
    weapons. There is never be a good reason to threaten the use of
    weapons. Either you're using them, or you aren't. Keep them
    holstered until they are being used.
-   You are a Corporate Security Officer. Not a police officer, private
    militia, or entity of a standing military. Your job is to ensure the
    safety of your corporation's investment (I.E. Smooth operation of
    your assigned station). Your job is not to chase bad guys out into
    the void, fight for freedom, or serve as a heavily armed SpecOps
    team.
-   If you have a complaint or concern that’s related to security, voice
    them to your HoS. Be respectful, but be honest. Problems won’t get
    better if nobody knows about them.
-   Report to an Internal Affairs Agent if your boss or another head of
    staff breaks the law. Even if they don’t get fired, CentCom still
    deserves to know.
-   If you are fired as security staff, you should go immediately to
    surrender their gear before anything else. Save any protests or
    Internal Affairs complaints until afterward. The moment the HoS or
    Colony Director says, “You’re fired,” you are instantly in
    possession of contraband, and will be arrested if you are not
    bringing it straight back to Security.
-   Talk first (unless a suspect lets their weapons do the talking).
-   Remember, Beepsky and other automated tools can be a useful tool in
    the apprehension of criminals.
-   Heads of Department have the final say over their department barring
    Central Command/Colony Director's ruling (i.e. don't just arrest
    people for vandalism because you think their redecorating sucks).
-   Ensure access is properly cleared with Heads of Departments barring
    exceptional circumstances (i.e. major crime in progress). Don't just
    break into another department to make an arrest over a minor crime.
-   Security can be difficult to play on a station where people eat each
    other. [Don't forget you can eat people
    too](/wiki/Guide_to_Vore "wikilink").
-   Security can be corrupt. Try to calm your fellow officers if they
    get too hotheaded on the job. <s>Also it is an unspoken rule among
    security staff to look the other way if an unruly prisoner or
    belligerent officer happens to end up coursing through another
    officer's guts.</s>

OOC Notes
---------

-   Jokes aside... seriously, do feel free to eat people as security. It
    doesn't happen nearly enough as we want it to. I put in the
    strike-through text to give you ideas. Have fun with them.
-   As with any role, try to do your job more often than not. Security
    is a popular role, and you won't be very well liked if you're only
    playing Security to carry a gun, but you're not doing any other
    parts of the job. If not, at least be intentionally abusing the role
    in a fun way for everyone else (see
    [Predcurity](/wiki/Guide_to_Security#How_to_abuse_your_power_as_Predcurity "wikilink")).
-   When in a conflict, roleplay until roleplay is no longer possible,
    such as if the suspect bolts off running or starts physically
    fighting. The server [Rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink") explain this in more
    detail.
-   Killing prisoners who don't deserve it, even through vore, **is
    still illegal and could get you fired**. So be sneaky about it if
    you plan on gurgling someone. Other officers might look the other
    way but don't rely on this.
-   Merely holding a suspect or prisoner in your belly isn't against any
    laws at all and CentCom will back you up on it if [some
    asshole](/wiki/Internal_Affairs_Agent "wikilink") complains about it.
-   If digestion freaks you out that badly that you have to pretend it
    never happens ever, **don't play security**. [You're gonna have a
    bad time](/wiki/You're_gonna_have_a_bad_time "wikilink").
-   Predators do best in security roles. Prey, conversely, does very
    poorly.
-   Have a thick skin OOCly and be prepared to talk to admins often.
    People don’t like being arrested. Security is the \#1 most
    drama-ridden job in *any* SS13 server, so you should be prepared to
    deal with that. If you do not react well under pressure, you will
    want to play something else. If you’re able to separate IC and OOC
    however, and you really like IC drama, then Security is the job for
    you.
-   If people get start complaining in OOC at you, involve an admin
    before you say anything else. Trying to argue with them usually just
    makes it worse.
-   On the other hand, if someone is being a special kind of thundercunt
    *in*-character after being arrested, such as constantly trying to
    escape, or throwing slurs at every officer who passes, or making
    rape threats, the admins *really* aren’t going to care a whole lot
    if you break their legs and leave them in solitary for the rest of
    the shift because you 'forgot' they were in there. In fact we admins
    consider this to be a reasonable IC response to someone being a
    shithead! You should still ahelp it, though.
    --[Aces](/wiki/User%3AAces "wikilink") ([talk](User_talk:Aces "wikilink"))
    23:45, 6 July 2017 (EDT)
-   If someone attempts suicide in prison, like jumping down disposals,
    or mutilating themselves, then ahelp it. They'll probably get
    banned.
-   If you're a person who enjoys having power, don't play Security. If
    you ignore this warning, you're going to be disturbed by how
    powerless you really are despite carrying weapons.

### How to abuse your power as Predcurity

Predcurity is a term used to describe predator characters who abuse
their position in security to hunt, eat, and often digest members of the
crew in a manner that is blatantly corrupt and against the law ICly. You
might be thinking this is a bad thing. Actually, it's something we wish
people would do more often. Here's some tips on how to abuse your powers
and get away with it, so long as it ends in vore.

-   **Always check your potential target's OOC notes before you do
    anything, and make sure their preferences are compatible with
    yours.**
-   Try to go after people who won't be missed. Assistants are the
    easiest targets. Command staff are the hardest. Pick your prey
    depending on how challenging you want the hunt to be, although going
    after the only member of a vital department like engineering or
    medical is probably a bad idea regardless.
-   If you are making an arrest, but you have no intention of bringing
    your snack to the brig, quietly neglect to report the arrest to
    everyone else.
-   If your desired meal hasn't done anything wrong, invent some trumped
    up charge on why you need to detain this person for questioning.
    Suspicious conduct is a good one to abuse. Even a simple, "Could you
    come with me?" without making an arrest often works fine too.
-   Avoid doing anything in very public areas. Try to draw your target
    away from the crowd.
-   The moment your victim is in handcuffs, remove their headset.
    Probably a good idea to take their PDA too. If they protest this,
    use whatever means you see fit to shut them up.
-   When you've captured someone, escort your victim into a maintenance
    shaft or anywhere without cameras.
-   When your prey is secure and no one is coming to help them, enjoy
    your meal.
-   If you're playing Warden, make sure you always enforce your
    authority over the brig, and that you process all incoming and
    outgoing prisoners normally. That way when you're hungry, no one
    will question why a prisoner has gone missing.
-   The Head of Security's office has tinted windows. Abuse this to deal
    with (eat) belligerent subordinate officers who have a problem with
    your methods.

These are just a few helpful tips. Get creative with it.

### What to do if you find a vore scene

This section has been moved to the [Guide to Vore regarding
Security](/wiki/Guide_to_Vore#Vore_and_Security "wikilink").

In general you should only care if the scene is **clearly** unwilling
(as in; more substantial than half-assed wriggling and muffling), or
it's in a public/disruptive area. If it's unwilling, follow the guide
linked above on what you can and cannot do. If it's public, or it's in
the way of other people, you *can* at least demand that they leave the
area, regardless of if it's willing or not.

And no, you should **not** demand to know whether the scene is willing.
If it isn't clear, as above, then it's none of your business and you
shouldn't be asking. ICly you've got absolutely no recourse if the pred
says it was willing anyway, and without probable cause to search their
stomach it's considered an invasion of privacy. The short version is
that it's not *their* job to prove it was willing to get you off their
case. This especially applies when all you see is the mechanical eating,
or happen to be walking past a tile when a single subtleemote goes off.
The message clearly isn't intended for you to see, so it may be
considered metagaming to act upon it.

Generally speaking, the above points are important for witnesses calling
security too. If it's not a situation where security should intervene,
generally speaking you shouldn't call them either.
