![](NoFunAllowed.jpg "fig:NoFunAllowed.jpg") Sometimes, [certain
rules](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure "wikilink") are really just
guidelines. The purpose of Vorestation is to have fun, ideally with the
[intended purpose that's literally in the god damn
title](/wiki/Vore "wikilink").

Some people think that's crazy talk, so this page is dedicated to people
who would rather Vorestation (and in fact, every SS13 server) give an
*authentic* experience with all the **FUN™** of a real workplace, except
with none of the pay. Here's what would help make Vorestation the cold
and unfeeling hard-scifi corporate experience that you want, just like
your normal day job, except *in space*.

<b>MOST BEST AUTHENTIC SPACEMEN EXPERIENCE™</b>
-----------------------------------------------

These are helpful suggestions submitted by players and admins on how to
create **MOST BEST AUTHENTIC SPACEMEN EXPERIENCE**™. If you hear a
helpful suggestion, add it to this list.

1.  Cargo will now deny all of your orders without the proper paperwork
    being filled out. Also the box of hats is removed.
2.  Speaking of hats, Ian can no longer wear hats. That's animal abuse.
3.  Security Officers can't use [unsanctioned](/wiki/Vore "wikilink") means of
    transporting prisoners.
4.  [Asset Protection](/wiki/Asset_Protection "wikilink") ceases to exist
    because Deathsquad is too grimdark.
5.  The [Emergency Response Team](/wiki/Emergency_Response_Team "wikilink")
    can only carry tasers and rubber bullets. Actually on second
    thought, they don't get weapons. They're basically firefighters and
    paramedics.
6.  [Vore](/wiki/Vore "wikilink") is unrealistic and therefore should be
    removed.
7.  Security has all lethal weapons removed. You're basically glorified
    mall cops, after all.
8.  In fact, just remove Security completely. It only causes drama.
9.  Engineers can't build anything without the explicit approval of the
    Chief Engineer, Colony Director, and Central Command.
10. Space OSHA must review all construction projects, and they'll be
    here some time in 2-3 weeks.
11. Xenobiology is banned from making slimes, because nothing good ever
    comes of it.
12. Everyone is banned from the [Gateway](/wiki/Gateway "wikilink"), because
    nothing good ever comes of it.
13. Staff are not allowed to leave their workplaces and must send
    regular status reports to the [Colony
    Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink"), this is a professional
    business.
14. Breaks are not allowed unless you've been working steady for 4
    hours, in which case, you're allowed a 30 minute meal break.
    Otherwise, get back to work.
