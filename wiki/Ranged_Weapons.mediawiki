This is a table of purpose-made ranged weaponry available in the game. The list may not perfectly represent the current state of the game, as the weapons may be rebalanced but the page may not be updated to reflect this for some time.

==Sidearms (Ballistic)==
Ballistic weapons remain a popular weapon in the 26th century, typically however Nanotrasen prefer the usage of Energy weapons over Ballistic weapons, so don't expect to see many ballistic weapons on station.

|Nanotrasen
|Another researched gun, if you can make this (more importantly, open that damn lockbox), chances are you can construct something better (read: laser cannon). Generally useless, except perhaps for killing slimes if you really don't want to get close.

|15 Burn + 30 Irradiate
|[[R&D Lab]] once researched first.
|Nanotrasen
|This beams from this gun will pass through everything but a wall. While it does do less burn damage, the radiation it inflicts causes toxin damage and can make someone mutate. Great for shooting up crowded hallways. Kills blobs dead. Current range of the gun is 15 tiles and drops further with every obstacle passed by the beam.
