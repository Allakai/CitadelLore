*Or: Banning For The Greater Good*

Quality control bans are bans for a player which has technically not
broken enough rules to warrant a normal permaban, but have either caused
enough continuous disruption to other players, generally create a toxic
environment, or detract from the server or setting in enough ways that
they must be removed to maintain a healthy server.

Quality control bans can be used in several cases, such as players
who...

-   Have exceptionally poor grammar or communication skills to the point
    where other players are regularly not able to understand or work
    with them in-game.
-   Are consistently negative towards the server, playerbase, or rules
    with no indications that they will seek entertainment elsewhere or
    work with others to rectify their complaints.
-   Maintain a consistently dour attitude in public, including making
    awkward negative comments about their self-worth and how much they
    are disliked.
-   Show no sign of interest in the server’s intended playstyle,
    content, playerbase (e.g. those that are grossed-out by vore but
    insist on being here).
-   Consistently form cliques or mobs to influence the server politics,
    generally phrased as demands for satisfaction contrary to the
    Mission Statement.
-   Repeatedly line-toe rules and debate with admins when told to stop
    doing so.

<big>**QC bans are dangerous!**</big>

They can lead to believing you can arbitrarily select people you do not
like and get rid of them, accusations of playing favorites, being early
20th century war-instigating polities, etc. In general, if someone is
making you **angry**, they are probably breaking a rule and would
warrant another type of ban. You should step away and reconsider your
feelings.

If you feel **sorry** for the person, and they show no signs of
improving, that may be the right time to QC ban them so they can seek
their fun elsewhere without harming the overall health of the server.

If it is ever found that you have attempted to QC ban someone for
unethical reasons (don’t like them, private disagreement, different vore
prefs, etc), you will be removed as staff, and will find yourself
regretting this decision.

**QC bans require 75% admin support from all current administration
staff. Developers and other staff can submit advisory opinions towards
the result, but are not considered part of the required 75%.**
