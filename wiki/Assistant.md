This job has no access. But it's good to play if you are [a
newbie](/wiki/New_Players "wikilink"), because you can have an infinite number
of assistants on a station. A [Head of
Personnel](/wiki/Head_of_Personnel "wikilink") can give you more access on
your [Identification Card](/wiki/Identification_Card "wikilink"), so you can
be something other than a random assistant.

Overview
--------

As an <s>Emergency Ration</s> Assistant, you'll want to either get a job
or just assist with various jobs around the station. Feel free to ask
over the radio if anyone would like any assistance. You don't have any
access, so it'll be pretty hard to get anywhere <s>or escape from a
predator once they lure you deep into a department</s>, but this is
still a good job for new players. It's also a good job to play if you
want to hop onto the station but not occupy any actual job slots or have
any specific duties <s>so you can get gurgled in peace</s>, but be
advised that the game is generally *much* more enjoyable if you take a
job that actually gives you something to do when you're not actively
engaged in <s><small>E</small></s>RP.
