== Chemicals ==
You have all sorts of things here, and can make so much. You can make medicines, foam, flash powder, poisons, space lube, and so much more. The limit on combinations is a limit that exists only in your creativity (and the game engine). Be sure to be careful though, mixing the wrong chemicals can be bad for your health and please make sure you know what a chemical does before you use it. Experiment at your own risk.

=== Medicine ===

The vast majority of chemicals you will be called on to make. Typically, a small amount of each should be kept on hand. Assuming the medical team is not incompetent, they should be able to keep everyone alive and quite healthy with your assistance. Formulas are formatted to be "mechanical recipe (how the game calculates it) '''OR''' practical recipe (how to make a bottle or two's worth using only a single beaker)". <u>Underlined</u> ingredients are not in the dispenser.

<br />
{{Chem

|formula = 2 parts Milk, 1 part Hydrogen, 1 part Potassium -> 3 parts Adranol
'''OR''' 60 Milk, 30 Hydrogen, 30 Potassium -> 90 Adranol
|effects = Fixes blurred vision, confusion and is the only chem to actually fix the jitters, with the exception of Impedrezene. Use this for resleeved patients, as well as patients being given Peridaxon or Oxycodone.
}}
<br />
{{Chem
|chemical = Alkysine
|formula = 1 part Chlorine, 1 part Nitrogen, 1 part <span title="1 part Nitrogen, 1 part Potassium, 1 part Silicon" style="text-decoration:underline">Dylovene</span> -> 2 part Alkysine

}}
<br />
{{Chem
|chemical = Dylovene
|formula = 1 part Silicon, 1 part Nitrogen, 1 part Potassium -> 3 part Dylovene
'''OR''' 40 Silicon, 40 Nitrogen, 40 Potassium -> 120 Dylovene
|effects = A broad-spectrum anti-toxin. Heals toxin damage; will also shorten the durations of drug-related hallucinations and sleepiness, and remove toxic substances in the blood. Metabolizes at 0.2 units per tick. Does not overdose.
