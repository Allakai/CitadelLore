A lot of people like **aliens**, either playing as, fighting against, or
being caressed by them. Alien events don't occur very often, but reading
this guide will prepare you in the event that it happens.

Remember, as an alien you can use :a to talk to the hivemind.

Overview
--------

Aliens arrive on the station in one of two ways.

The first way is for the random event where CentCom broadcasts that an
Unidentified Lifesign has been detected aboard the station. This means
that in a very few random places around the station, facehuggers and
eggs have been seeded. They can pop up almost anywhere, even right next
to you. This almost never happens, as aliens are turned off by default
for random events.

The second way is for admins to spawn them. This can either be as a
forced random event that is exactly like the CentCom alert, or by just
spawning some facehuggers and/or eggs somewhere on the station. This is
most often the case and is usually an event on the server.

### As a Xeno

![Alien-Infested Escape
Shuttle](Alienshuttle.png "fig:Alien-Infested Escape Shuttle") This
guide is fairly comprehensive and long. Playing as aliens and against
aliens takes some finesse, so make sure to read it all.

#### Prologue - Facehuggers

***An alien is on my face, help!***

If a facehugger jumps onto, or is thrown onto someones face, it usually
rips off the mask (if they have one) and attempts to infect the person
it's on. If the facehugger is taken off in the first few seconds, the
person is usually not affected. Some helmets/masks will prevent
facehuggers from latching onto your face, such as Bio Hoods.

Being facehugged is not a guarantee of infestation. There is at least a
small chance that you will not become the host to an alien Larva.

If you've been infected, there will usually be telltale signs. You'll
feel sick. Your throat will be sore. You'll cough a lot. These symptoms
mean you are forming a larva. Using a [Health
Analyzer](/wiki/Health_Analyzer "wikilink") will show an Unidentified Foreign
Body if you are infected.

There are a couple of way to deal with this. Either ripping out the
larva through [Surgery](/wiki/Surgery "wikilink"), or having you scanned and
ready to clone when you eventually explode. Hydroponics cloning is also
a viable method. Note that you will be gibbed when the larva comes out,
so there's very little hope for you after that.

You may just be killed to stop the infection from spreading if none of
these options are available to you.

#### Phase One - As a Larva

***I'm a larva, what do I do?***

-   You've just spawned and are weak.
-   Above the chat window is your status window. It has index tabs.
    Click the Alien tab. It shows you all your alien powers.
-   As a larva you cannot attack and you have no special alien powers
    aside from 'Crawl through Vent'.
-   You can talk to the hivemind by using 'say ":a' (e.g. Say ":a I'm an
    alien!").

If there's anyone around when you burst, you may be spotted and killed.
Run for your life. Finding a vent is your best, and probably only chance
of survival.

-   If you're not in a good spot, find the nearest vent and crawl
    through it.
-   A good spot is anywhere where you A) are not likely to be found
    and B) have an easy access vent. If it's dark, that's even better,
    since someone who comes inside may not see you unless they get
    close.

You can crawl through vents faster than anyone is going to react to your
presence, so don't be afraid to scout out as many locations as you can
to figure out the best place to hide.

-   If for any reason your hiding place is found out, don't be afraid to
    crawl through the vents and find a new place.
-   If you're stuck in a room with no vents, and doors you can't open,
    turn "hide" on in the alien tab and hide under the table. Hopefully
    nobody will know you're there.
-   Once you're in your spot, sit and wait to evolve.

Under your 'Status' tab, there's a progress bar. When it reaches 200,
you'll recieve a pop-up window with choices on how to evolve.

#### Phase Two - As an Adult Xeno

***I'm a Xeno! Now what?***

As an adult Xeno, you have a lot more freedom in what you can do. Your
intents are slightly different from a humans.

-   **Help** - You nuzzle other aliens and caress humans. Fairly
    pointless.
-   **Stun** - You tackle humans and knock them down for quite a while.
    You also harmlessly bite other Xenos.
-   **Harm** - You slash at humans doing \~20 damage. You can also
    'wound' them which causes them to fall over and deals an extra \~10
    damage. You also harmlessly bite other Xenos.
-   **Grab** - Much the same as a human, however when you aggressively
    grab a human, you can then click yourself to devour them. This takes
    some time, and they can escape if they aren't stunned. Only hunters
    can then regurgitate humans they have eaten. Be careful, as humans
    can still move around in your stomach, and if they have sharp
    implements, they may just break out. You also harmlessly bite other
    Xenos.
-   Hunt and Stalk are Run and Walk respectively.

Below are a summary of the classes:

-   **Hunters** - Are strong and agile, able to hunt away from the hive
    and rapidly move through ventilation shafts. Hunters generate plasma
    slowly and have low reserves. The fastest and strongest physically.
    -   Has 150% health.
    -   Builds 5 plasma per tick, to a maximum of 150 plasma.
    -   Hits for around \~22 damage.
-   **Sentinels** - Are tasked with protecting the hive and are deadly
    up close and at a range. They are not as physically imposing nor
    fast as the hunters.
    -   Has 150% health.
    -   Builds 10 plasma per tick, to a maximum of 250 plasma.
    -   Hits for around \~20 damage.
-   **Drones** - Are the working class, offering the largest plasma
    storage and generation. They are the only caste which may evolve
    again, turning into the dreaded alien queen. The weakest and
    slowest.
    -   Has 100% health.
    -   Builds 15 plasma per tick, to a maximum of 500 plasma.
    -   Hits for around \~18 damage.

If you are the first, or one of the first Larva to evolve, you want to
become a Drone, as you'll need a Queen to be able to make eggs, then get
facehuggers, then make more larva.

-   STOP RIGHT THERE. Don't just run off to kill people. Or ever.
    Infesting is always better than killing.
-   As an alien, killing someone is something you never want to do.
    Ever. Killing them means you can't get them infested, and infesting
    them is what you want to be doing.
-   Revealing yourself now is probably not a good move. Hold off until
    you've built up your nest.

Xenomorphs run on plasma. Your body stores plasma and your powers need
it to work. You can absorb plasma two ways: plasma in the air and weeds.
These effects can stack. Below are a list of some of your powers:

**Hunter:**

-   **Activate facehuggers** - Takes (5) plasma and guarantees that a
    facehugger will latch onto a human and start infesting them if
    thrown or walked over.
-   **Crawl through Vent** - Requires no plasma and is exactly the same
    as doing it as a larva. You can select any location that still has
    unwelded vents.
-   **Invisibility** - Takes (50) plasma and turns you completely
    invisible for a short while.MORE NTOES AJGAJGA
-   **Plant Weeds** - Takes (50) plasma, and it something you should be
    doing often. Makes purple sacs which spawn weeds around them and
    allow aliens to heal and build up plasma on them. Again, these are
    very important.
-   **Regurgitate** - Takes no plasma, and expels anyone you have
    devoured from your stomach. You can devour people by grabbing them
    aggressively and then clicking on yourself, though it takes a while.
-   **Transfer Plasma** - Allows you to transfer an amount of plasma to
    another alien, as long as you're adjacent to them.
-   **Whisper** - Takes (10) plasma, and allows you to send a private
    message to anyone in sight range. Can be understood by anyone, even
    humans.

**Sentinel:**

-   **Activate facehuggers**
-   **Corrode with Acid** - Takes (200) plasma and can melt almost any
    object adjacent to you. It does take a while though, and can't melt
    reinforced walls. Also appears in the right-click menu.
-   **Crawl through Vent**
-   **Plant Weeds**
-   **Spit Corrosive Acid** - Seems to be broken. Does nothing.
-   **Spit Neurotoxin** - Takes (50) plasma and causes anyone hit to
    fall over for a short time. Travels like a taser electrode, so be
    careful.
-   **Transfer Plasma**
-   **Whisper**

**Drone:**

-   **Corrode with Acid** - Takes (200) plasma and can melt almost any
    object adjacent to you. It does take a while though, and can't melt
    reinforced walls. Also appears in the right-click menu.
-   **Crawl through Vent**
-   **Evolve** - Takes (500) plasma, and allows a drone to evolve into a
    Queen.
-   **Plant Weeds**
-   **Shape Resin** - Takes (100) plasma and allows you to spawn a resin
    wall or membrane where you're standing. Membranes let light through
    but are weaker, walls are stronger but don't block light.
-   **Spit Corrosive Acid**
-   **Transfer Plasma**
-   **Whisper**

`If you don't plant weeds, you won't build plasma, so plant those weeds and store some up. If you waste your plasma before you plant weeds you are screwed, unless plasma is in the air, and even then you absorb far more plasma over time from weeds.`

-   Now comes decision time. Do you want to evolve into a queen or be a
    marauding hunter/sentinel?
-   If you are the first (or one of the first) aliens, you should evolve
    into a queen. Without a queen, there is no way to spawn additional
    facehuggers, and no way to expand the brood. Aliens are not a threat
    without facehuggers, so queens are a must-have.
-   If there's already a queen, you can choose to stay as a regular
    adult and start creating chaos. There are good reasons to do this.
    Queens move slow and cannot vent crawl, so having hunter aliens
    makes collecting new hosts much easier.

For the sake of this guide we will assume you are one of the first
aliens, but if you join as an alien partway into the infestation of the
station you can skip to the final phase.

-   Since you probably want to become a queen, you'll have to pick
    Drone. Your best bet is to just sit tight and build up 500 plasma to
    evolve. The sooner, the better.
-   The crew may probably be looking for you at this point, so make sure
    you're in a relatively safe spot.
-   Once you evolve you are very slow and won't be able to vent crawl.
    You will be very vulnerable until you build up an army of
    facehuggers, so plan your nesting ground accordingly.
-   If for any reason you know that the genetics lab or toxin lab are no
    longer being used and the monkeys are still alive, nest there.
-   During this time you can continue to scout around through various
    vents and see where people on the station are.
-   Jumping through vents and planting additional weeds in random places
    is a great way to divert attention from wherever your actual nest
    is. The crew will be distracted at the sight of weeds, so it's often
    worth it even though it does slow your progression to queen.
-   Now it's time to play the waiting game again. 500 plasma and it's on
    to phase three.

#### Phase Three - As a Queen

***I'm a queen, but how is babby formed?***

-   **Queen** - Large, slow, and slightly tougher, but not any more
    physically powerful than the rest of the Xenos. The only Xeno that
    can lay facehugger eggs.
    -   Has 250% health.
    -   Builds 20 plasma per tick, to a maximum of 500 plasma.
    -   Hits for around \~18 damage.

**Powers:**

-   **Activate facehuggers**
-   **Corrode with Acid**
-   **Lay Egg** - Takes (200) plasma. Your unique skill. Lays an egg
    which will hatch into a facehugger. Facehuggers can then be used to
    make more larva.
-   **Plant Weeds**
-   **Spit Corrosive Acid**
-   **Spit Neurotoxin**
-   **Transfer Plasma**
-   **Whisper**

<!-- -->

-   Let's get this out of the way. First, you can caress anyone with
    your scythe-like arm by clicking on them an empty hand, with the
    Help intent active, while they're next to you. This has absolutely
    no effect.
-   You're a queen. Awesome. You get some nifty bonuses and defects
    compared to regular aliens. Let's go over them.
    -   **Cons:** You are slow. Snail's pace. You also can't vent crawl.
        You basically have zero mobility compared to everything else in
        the game. You also stand out with a unique sprite.
    -   **Pros:** You can lay eggs, you build plasma much faster, and
        you have more health.
-   Your first task is to lay an egg. You start with 250 plasma even
    though you needed 500 to evolve, and you'll build more very quickly.
-   If at any point in time you have plasma built up and don't know what
    to do with it, lay another egg. Laying more eggs increases the
    facehugger swarm and is your best weapon against the humans.
-   You can open any door that isn't ID locked, but locked and/or bolted
    doors require that you spit corrosive acid on them. Corrosive acid
    is your all-access pass to the station. If you're stuck for any
    reason, or want to get in somewhere (example, rooms with monkeys or
    plasma tanks), use acid. It takes a while to eat through doors
    usually, so spit early and lay eggs while you wait.
-   Alone, aliens are weak, and a queen even more so. One lucky
    assistant with a toolbox to the head can end your infestation very
    quickly, so don't let it happen. Always lay low and keep a wall of
    eggs and facehuggers between you and anywhere humans can get at you
    from.

<!-- -->

-   Remember to spit Neurotoxin on those who get too close (right-click
    them, or use your alien tab). This should stun them for long enough
    to let you get away.
-   You can take items off humans, though knowing what they do is very
    metagamey, so be cautious.
-   Drag anyone you incapacitate back towards the heart of your hive.
    Make sure that when they get back up, a facehugger will be within
    jumping range. Once they're impregnated, feel free to drag them to
    some dark corner and protect them until they explode into a new
    alien baby.
-   Monkeys are viable facehugger targets, and are a fantastic way to
    rapidly expand the size of your brood without needing to hunt down
    humans. From a meta standpoint, they also let more players into the
    game without killing anyone, so it gets more ghosts back to playing,
    which is always good.
-   Once you've amassed an army of facehuggers, and hopefully ambushed a
    couple of unsuspecting crew who were unfortunate enough to stumble
    on your nest, you should communicate closely with the other aliens
    and prepare to start really branching out across the station. You've
    already started this, probably, especially since the other alien
    players are probably being more aggressive than you.

#### General Advice

-   You do not need air to breathe as a Xenomorph! Feel free to walk
    around the outside of the station and make a good safe area to plant
    weeds and store plasma on (i.e., the solars, or toxins test area if
    no one is bombing or has bombed it). You can also spit acid on
    windows/grills to destroy them, so any window is a potential entry
    point. If you get spaced you're usually out of luck, though!
-   The atmospherics vent leads to a safe 3x3 room with a single
    cannister inside it. Go here if you really have nowhere else to go,
    as it's 99% safe. Only bombs can get you there and even the AI can't
    see that room.
-   You can see in the dark, and humans can't. Destroying light sources
    may be useful.
-   You can also pick up anything medium sized or larger, such as boxes
    and backpacks.

### As a Human

***Aliens! Help!***

-   Try to keep yourself and others around you calm. It's no good
    running around screaming and getting massacred by Xenos.
-   Roleplay is still in effect, regardless of the large alien
    monstrosities. Try to keep In Character.
-   If someone gets infested, make sure they get medical care ASAP.
    [Surgery](/wiki/Surgery "wikilink") can remove a xenomorph Larva, but
    otherwise cloning will have to do.
-   If no other option is avaliable, killing or isolating the infected
    will help stop the spread of xenomorphs.
-   Crew members may seek to make peaceful contact with the aliens. This
    can lead to peaceful cooperation for both parties, but may just end
    up in a large amount of dead on both sides.

***They're everywhere! What now?***

If all other options have failed, combat may be the only option.

-   Try to declare red alert. This will at the very least keep people
    alert, and may get you access to the [Emergency Response
    Team](/wiki/Emergency_Response_Team "wikilink").
-   Lasers and bullets work on Xenomorphs, however, they also work on
    people. Keep your firing lanes clear!
-   Melee weapons are not recommended unless you're in groups. A single
    Xenomorph can tackle you and then have enough time to put a
    facehugger on you or kill you.
-   To avoid increasing Xeno numbers, destroying monkeys may be useful.
-   Restrain individuals who wish to spread the infection or are helping
    hostile xenomorphs.
-   Flashes don't work on xenomorphs, though flashbangs do.
-   You best bet to escape a fight is to use a stun weapon and then run.
-   If fighting to kill (which should not be done unless absolutely
    necessary) stunning and then beating is effective.
-   Larva should be killed if possible.
-   Welding vents restrict Xenomorph mobility.
-   Fire works on structures made by Xenomorphs \*(alien weeds, eggs,
    purple sacs, etc.), but Xenos themselves are immune to fire and
    cold.
-   Seriously consider calling the escape shuttle.

***I'm the only one left!***

-   Make sure you're the only one left. Use radios, intercoms, or PDA
    messages to contact any potential survivors.
-   If you have weapons, use them.
-   Make your way to the bridge or the captain's quarters and try to
    call the shuttle. It's the only way out now.
-   If the shuttle is here, get on it, weld the doors shut, make sure
    nothing is in there with you, and hide as best you can. Central
    Command has a plan for this sort of thing.
-   If you are eaten alive by xenos, there's only one way out. Take out
    your oxygen bottle or any other weapon in your hand, and move around
    as much as possible. You'll slam the thing you're holding into the
    alien's stomach lining, and if you do it enough you may explode out
    of the aliens chest cavity like some kind of reverse-larvae. Sharp
    implements work best.
-   If the shuttle isn't coming, write a book of warning and contempt
    and throw yourself into space. Alternatively find a corner to cry
    in.

Fluff
-----

### Facehugger

![](Facehugger.gif "fig:Facehugger.gif") A parasitic cycle in xenomorph
production with the appearance of two [human](crew "wikilink") hands
held together and attached to a spiny, powerful tail. It has a proboscis
it uses to implant embryos and provide oxygen while strangling a victim.
The finger-like appendages are used for transportation and to attach
itself firmly to a host body.

Once implantation is complete, the facehugger falls off and dies.
Removal of a facehugger while it is copulating is always fatal for the
victim, either because of a snapped neck, trauma from the facehugger
ripping off the face of its victim, or the powerfully acidic blood of
the xeno. Victims rarely remember implantation or even the act of being
jumped in most cases, likely because of the asphyxiation caused by a
facehugger's tail during the process and the psychological trauma of the
act.

Like all of the xenomorph species, not much is understood about its
growth, motivations, or senses, but it is known that a facehugger can
tell the difference between a living humanoid and a non-living humanoid
such as corpses or [cyborgs](robotics#Cyborg "wikilink") and that they
are suicidally focused on reproduction. Xenomorphs often use crowds of
facehuggers to take down large prey or grouped or well-defended humans.

### Larva

![](Larva.png "fig:Larva.png") Also known as chestbursters because of
their method of exodus from the host body, larval xenomorphs are the
third known stage in reproduction for that species. While developing in
the body, xenomorph embryos attach to blood vessels to absorb nutrients
and complete its unstable genetic structure using the host's DNA.

Through an unknown process, this always results in a functioning
offspring. This form is small compared to the adult, limbless, and
serpentine. They have a strong instinct to hide after forcing their way
out through the ribcage and violently tearing their host body apart. If
left alone, xenomorph larva will undergo an unknown transformation
process to adulthood.

It is believed at this stage that the xenomorph is at its most
vulnerable due to its small size and apparent lack of many senses,
though this should not be misunderstood -- a larva is still deadly. Its
powerful thrashing and sharp teeth got it out of a human sternum, after
all.

### Hunter

![](Alien.png "fig:Alien.png") This form is usually the last in any
given xenomorph's life cycle. There are many variants of the hunter
(including forms that do no hunting, per se), but the human form is the
most commonly seen on stations for obvious reasons.

The hunter sports a phallic-shaped skull with hidden, mostly useless
eyes protected by a one-way transparent dome. It has a host of esoteric
senses, most prominently a theorized echolocation (explaining their
near-constant hissing) and electroreception, though its primary sense
appears to be smell. The scent of pheromones is experimentally shown to
be the primary communication device of xenomorphs, most effectively
transmitted by the ropey purple weeds the adults spread around the
station. It is unknown where this tissue comes from, as xenomorphs
refuse to make it in captivity.

The primary byproduct of this weed is the strange substance
[plasma](backstory#Nanotrasen "wikilink") and as such most corporations
are extremely interested in the connection between the xenomorphs and
that chemical for production reasons. Like the facehugger, the hunter's
blood is highly acidic, and there are rumors that it is capable of
eating even through space station hulls, though it must be said that
this is only a rumor.

The adult xenomorph is a living weapon, with an exoskeleton thick enough
to absorb or redirect most trauma and temperature extremes, scythe-like
claws, and a multi-tiered jaw system capable of projecting an acidic
compound presumingly from their stomachs. Some varieties of hunter are
crested, and most varieties have a heavy tail with protective ridges.
Xenomorphs at this stage show semi-sapience and problem-solving
abilities, and are capable of using pack-oriented tactics, creative
stealth, and psychological manipulation. It is reported that in the
presence of enough plasma xenomorphs can communicate in a basic way with
sentient species, but there is little evidence to lend credence to such
an absurd notion.

### Queen

![](Queen.png "fig:Queen.png") Very few xenomorphs undergo the
transformation into queen. It appears to be done only in the case of
very specific hive pressures. They are the only xenomorphs capable of
laying the eggs that hatch facehuggers. While much larger than the
hunters, they're also much slower, but are indeed much tougher. Even
accounting for the size difference, a xenomorph queen can take
drastically more punishment. A queen is most likely found where there
are high levels of [plasma](/wiki/Backstory#Nanotrasen "wikilink"), surrounded
by hunters and swarms of freshly hatched facehuggers.

They are significantly more intelligent and highly protective of their
offspring. While slow, they have all the adaptations and weapons of
their previous hunter forms, a larger, thicker crest to protect their
brain casing, and higher internal stores of plasma which they can
utilize for the shaping of resin, the laying of eggs, destructive
survival defenses, and even a complex and poorly understood efficient
means to form a natural
[cloak](/wiki/Syndicate_Items#Cloaking_Device "wikilink"). Like all
xenomorphs, there is little information about them.

Oddities
--------

-   You can perform CPR on any Xeno as a human, but they have to be
    under -50% HP and have suffocation damage for it to work.
-   Below 0% HP , aliens will gasp, but not take suffocation damage.
    Below -50% HP, they'll pass out and take suffocation damage.
-   Larva cannot die when they reach full progress and recieve a pop-up
    window.
-   Regular Aliens can't understand humans, and humans can't understand
    aliens. A [pAI](pAI "wikilink") with a universal translator can talk
    to them, and a Queen is able to converse normally. Regular aliens
    can whisper into a humans head to talk to them.
