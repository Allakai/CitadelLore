As a **Chef** it's your job to cook for the crew and keep them fed.
Really, that's it.

Equipment
---------

You get a lot of cool kitchen related things, like these:

-   An apron and cool looking hat.
-   2 Meat Spikes.
-   A gibber.
-   A machine that can dispense trays, plates, cups, and knives.
-   2 microwaves.
-   A Smart Fridge.
-   A CondiMaster that allows you to separate and bottle liquid
    ingredients.
-   Shutters to close you in for privacy or [other
    things](/wiki/Traitor "wikilink").
-   Rolling Pin.
-   Blender.
-   Drinks dispenser that will also dispense some ingredients, such as
    sugar.
-   Salt and pepper shakers.
-   A nifty (but now outdated) cookbook.
-   Eggs.
-   Meat.
-   Flour.
-   Space Milk and Soy Milk.
-   [Universal Enzyme](/wiki/Universal_Enzyme "wikilink").
-   Partial Hydroponics access which allows you to grow your own
    ingredients and use the biogenerator in the absence of a gardener.

### Meatgrinder

![](Meatgrinder.png "Meatgrinder.png")

The Meatgrinder is a device that is found in the [Kitchen
Freezer](/wiki/Kitchen_Freezer "wikilink"). It can be used to grind up living
or dead animals, turning them into a horrible bloody mess and yielding
some [Meat](/wiki/Meat "wikilink") chunks. However, the meatgrinder does not
[normally](/wiki/Syndicate_Items#Electromagnetic_Card "wikilink") accept
humans. The meat can then be used in [food production](/wiki/Food "wikilink").

Recipes

Drinks](/wiki/Guide_to_Food_and_Drinks "wikilink").

Cooking and You
---------------

Experimenting is unfortunately not rewarded with cooking. You'll just
end up with a burned mess that is NOT good to eat. If a microwave gets
dirty, you'll need to give it a blast of Space Cleaner. If a microwave
gets broken, you'll need some either a wrench or a screwdriver to repair
it.

The processor and the blender are much more forgiving. The processor
will only take things that it recognizes and the blender will blend any
food item (granted, you might not get anything interesting out of it).
You also have a CondiMaster to separate and identify anything you
produce with your blender.

You can cut various dishes with the knife you have, such as cheese
wheels and pizzas.

### Hydroponics

Your neighbor, [hydroponics](/wiki/Botanist "wikilink"), is tasked mainly with
growing vegetables and fruits for you to use in your dishes. They will
dump what they produce into the smart fridge that is located in both of
your walls. Be sure to tell them what to grow, as they are currently
incapable of reading your mind. A good starting task to tell them is to
grow wheat, tomatoes, and potatoes, as these plants are used most in
your recipes. After they have those, just request plants as needed. They
are also capable of producing milk and meat with biomass, which can
become very useful if you do not have [a cargo
staff](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink") to order cattle from.

If you have no gardener, you can access part of the garden from your
kitchen, including four hydroponics trays, the biogenerator, and seed
and fertilizer machines.

Ordering chickens for the gardener is a good step to take if you know
you'll be needing more eggs than the ones you start with. Feed them with
wheat to get them to lay eggs. Unattended eggs may hatch into more
chickens. Chickens can also be put into the meat grinder to make chicken
meat.

### Animals

Monkeys can be stuck up on meat hooks for meat carvery purposes, and
Cows can be ordered from the [Quartermaster](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink")
and used in the gibber. They can also be milked with a bucket, but they
do require feeding. Chickens produce eggs, which can also be quite
helpful. Feed chickens and cows with wheat to get them to produce milk
and eggs.

### Blending

All food contains the universal ingredient called "Nutriment." It's what
nourishes you and heals your injuries when you eat. Although food might
not heal you as quickly as the doctor can, and won't heal the more
unusual types of damage, it can often heal for more over time.

You can blend anything that comes from botany, and pretty much all food.
Nutriment can be added to your dishes to make them more filling. Some
plants contain other liquids that can be used as condiments or as
ingredients in food.

Traitoring
----------

Traitor Chef is an interesting position. You can take syringes full of
nasty [chemicals](/wiki/Chemist "wikilink") and inject it into food items. If
you have a compatriot in Hydroponics, they can grow you some poisonous
shrooms which you can then refine with the Blender and ChemMaster. Don't
forget your knife and rolling pin, the pin causes partial blindness, and
the knife has pretty good damage, which can be useful in a pinch.

Remember, the gibber only accepts humans when emagged, so decide if it's
worth the telecrystals.
