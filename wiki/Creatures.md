There are many types of life in space, not all of it good.

Species
-------

NanoTrasen practices some interesting equal diversity laws. As such, you
may find some of your other crew members to be slightly different than
the norm.

### [Humans](/wiki/Human "wikilink")

Leading race of [Nanotrasen](/wiki/Nanotrasen "wikilink"). They come typically
from [Mars and Earth](/wiki/Fluff#Locations "wikilink") and are the most
numerous station crew members.

### [Tajaran](/wiki/Tajaran "wikilink")

Feline-esque humanoids hired by Nanotrasen to work on their vessels.
They hail from [Ahdomai](/wiki/Ahdomai "wikilink") and have found a new home
as (*typically second class*) workers in space. They are one of the more
numerous species next to Humans, and have integrated quite well into the
station society.

### [Unathi](/wiki/Unathi "wikilink")

Lizard-esque humanoids *"recently"* hired by Nanotrasen, these
cold-blooded employees have been assigned to various low-ranking jobs on
the station, such as [janitorial work](/wiki/Janitor "wikilink") or
[botany](/wiki/Botanist "wikilink"). However, other companies have been heard
of recruiting them as well.

### [Skrell](/wiki/Skrell "wikilink")

A race of humanoid gelatinous beings, who dedicate themselves to
exploring the mind. They are very technologically advanced.

### [Dionaea](/wiki/Dionaea "wikilink")

Sapient, plant-like creatures with slow metabolisms that are, in fact, a
cluster of smaller, individual organisms. Originally discovered around
[Epsilon Ursae Minoris](/wiki/Epsilon_Ursae_Minoris "wikilink"), these
intelligent creatures have since been hired by Nanotrasen in a number of
positions.

### [Synthmorph](/wiki/Synthmorph "wikilink")

Not really a race in and of themselves, these are synthetic beings
recently allowed to work on Nanotrasen vessels due to a buy-out program.
They are often former Cyborg or AI minds, moved into their new body
without any laws other than spacelaw.

Other Lifeforms
---------------

[Vox](/wiki/Vox "wikilink") - Space Pirates, thieves, merchants, traders.
Known decently enough by Nanotrasen workers to be feared and hated.

[Mice](/wiki/Mice "wikilink") - Lives in maintenance tunnels, kitchen, and
toilets. Spawns near vents. Officially playable by
[ghosts](/wiki/Ghost "wikilink").

Slimes - Gelatinous test subjects typically used in xenobiological
laboratories

Critters
--------

This is the guide to Critters.

### What you need to know about critters

Critters are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence, not to be
confused with the [AI](/wiki/AI "wikilink"). This AI is remarkably limited in
many respects, which most often manifests in subpar pathfinding and
limited reaction to the physics systems that human controlled mobs have
to deal with. This makes them unpredictable and frustrating as both
allies and opponents.

Critters are divided into three categories:

### Helpful

![Floorbot\|link=Roboticist\#Floorbot](Floorbot.gif "fig:Floorbot|link=Roboticist#Floorbot")![Cleanbot\|link=Roboticist\#Cleanbot](Cleanbot.gif "fig:Cleanbot|link=Roboticist#Cleanbot")![Medibot\|link=Roboticist\#Medibot](Medibot.gif "fig:Medibot|link=Roboticist#Medibot")  
The [Roboticist](/wiki/Roboticist "wikilink")'s janitor bots, medibots and
floorbots are helpful critters. They help human players! Janitor bots
will always be helpful; even if hacked they still clean floors, albeit
in a more sloppy way. Unless a medibot is hacked or loaded with improper
chemicals, it will always help wounded players, but needs to actually be
loaded to do anything useful. Floorbots behave similarly. Normally they
repair flooring on any opened space tile, but when hacked, they expose
floor tiles to open space instead.

### Neutral

![Security
Robot](Securitron.gif "fig:Security Robot")![Roboticist\#ED-209\|Security
Robot](ED209.png "fig:Roboticist#ED-209|Security Robot")![Lizard](Lizard.png "fig:Lizard")  
Security robots and lizards are examples of neutral critters. Unless
ordered otherwise, hacked, attacked, or otherwise provoked, the security
bots will ignore a human player. Lizards and Mice are harmless and will
not attack unless provoked, preferring instead to choose random
directions to travel in every few moments.

### Hostile

![Space Carp](Carp.gif "fig:Space Carp")  
Space Carp are violet-colored space fish that often attack the station.
They can usually be seen outside the station through the windows. They
enter the station via meteor breaches or any open airlocks leading to
space. If a Space Carp manages to catch you, it will knock you out and
start crunching on you - slowly and painfully, until you die. Space
Carps can be, however, killed easily using a RIPLEY's drill or any
lethal weapon.
