[Corporate Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") is the name
for the current regulations in effect on the station at any given time.
It also provides common and uncommon offenses and suggested punishments
for them.

This is not a general guide to Security. All new officers should review
the official [Guide to Security](/wiki/Guide_to_Security "wikilink").

The following are all sentences you can apply to prisoners during your
work as a member of Security.

It's important to remember that while the regulations on their own are
mostly a suggestion, you are expected to follow them as a guideline. For
example, you are not required to give a sentence if the problem can be
resolved in alternative way that the suspect agrees to, such as
community service, or peer mediation.

To understand how to go about a proper arrest, or other clarifications
such a Prisoner Rights, Alert Levels, and more, see [Standard Operating
Procedure](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure "wikilink"). Note that Standard
Operating Procedure (SOP) is not enforced by threat of arrest or fine,
so security should not be enforcing it. It is up to heads of staff and
[Internal Affairs](/wiki/Internal_Affairs "wikilink") to handle these
policies.

### Interpretation of the Law

A good working knowledge of Corporate Regulations is important for any
person on the station. It can be the difference between a shiny pair of
handcuffs and sipping drinks in the bar. More in-depth interpretations
of Corporate Regulations are required for such positions as the
[Warden](/wiki/Warden "wikilink"), [Head of
Personnel](/wiki/Head_of_Personnel "wikilink"), [Colony
Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink"), and the [Head of
Security](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink").

For certain crimes, the accused party's intent is important. The
difference between 'assault' and 'attempted murder' can be very hard to
ascertain. It is important to note though, that 'assault' and 'attempted
murder' are mutually exclusive. You cannot be charged with 'assault' and
'attempted murder' from the same crime as the intent of each is
different. Likewise, 'assault with a deadly weapon' and 'assaulting an
officer' are also crimes that exclude others. Pay careful attention to
the requirements of each law and select the one that best fits the crime
when deciding sentence.

If the crime has a victim involved who chooses **not** to press charges
*specific to them*, security may **not** decide to press charges anyway.
It doesn't matter why. If someone punches someone else, security can
still arrest the assailant, but if the victim decides they would rather
talk it out instead of them getting jail time, then security should let
them do it. Arresting them anyway falls under wrongful arrest. Note, the
victim must **choose** this option. A murder victim cannot voice their
choice and therefore cannot choose to drop charges.
<sub>(Note\ that\ not\ all\ killings\ are\ murder\ -\ see\ **Victim\ In\ A\ Willfully\ Dangerous\ Position**,\ below,\ if\ the\ victim\ is\ resleeved\ and\ testifies\ that\ it\ was\ willing,\ or\ the\ accused\ testifies\ that\ it\ was\ willing\ and\ there\ is\ no\ evidence\ to\ the\ contrary)</sub>

This does not mean a victim can excuse **all** crimes committed by the
assailant, only the crimes committed **directly** against them. Security
can still charge the assailant for crimes that, while may have happened
at the same time as crimes committed against the victim, did not
directly involve the victim. This includes crimes against other people
and to property belonging to the base/station/etc. The victim cannot
speak on behalf of these entities.

Victims suffering from non-contiguous memory disorder may be unreliable
witnesses. See [Non-Contiguous Memory
Disorder](/wiki/Non-Contiguous_Memory_Disorder "wikilink") for more
information.

In the case of violent crimes (assault, manslaughter, attempted murder
and murder), and theft (petty, pickpocketing, and high value) take only
the most severe.

A single incident has a single sentence, so if, for instance, the
prisoner took 3 items off someone, this is a single count of
pickpocketing.

Keep in mind that people that cause major mayhem (and potentially any
other criminals) have probably committed more than one crime. Add the
time for each case together.

Aiding a criminal makes you an accomplice; you can be charged with the
same crime as the person you aided.

As an arresting officer, follow the [Guide to
Security](/wiki/Guide_to_Security "wikilink") to ensure you don't fall foul of
legal proceedings.

Some crimes may have a fine tied to them, in this case, the detained
person may either serve the sentence given to them, or pay a fine. Fines
can be processed using an EFTPOS scanner or by paying cash from an ATM.
Do note, however, that your [Head of
Security](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink") will most likely need to set up
an EFTPOS scanner for you, as they need to be configured to place fines
into the station security account. Otherwise, turn the cash in to a
Warden for safe keeping, or directly to the the Head of Security who can
add it to the security account.

### Additional

The Colony Director is not above Corporate Regulations, and can be
arrested by Security for breaking it. The only time that the Corporate
Regulations can be overridden is when there is an imminent and
overwhelming threat to the station, such as during Code Delta
evacuations.

Pardons are only legitimate if they come from a NanoTrasen higher-up
(that is, someone who ranks above the Colony Director). Despite his high
ranking, the Colony Director cannot spit in the face of Corporate
Regulations, and any attempts to do so are infractions.

If you can't find the incident listed in here you can set up a tribunal.
See [Legal Standard Operating
Procedure](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations#Legal_Standard_Operating_Procedure "wikilink").

Tribunals should be held in place of hearings or trials. Trials by jury
or 'regular' trials are usually done very badly, so don't. See [Legal
Standard Operating
Procedure](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations#Legal_Standard_Operating_Procedure "wikilink").

Do **NOT** demand a tribunal for anything less than 10 minutes. You'll
just be laughed at.

The time you took for bringing the suspect in and the time you spend
questioning are NOT to be calculated into this. This is the pure time
someone spends in a cell staring at the wall.

You should apply the suggested sentence unless the Head of Security or
Colony Director demands otherwise, or the arrested individual has been a
continual problem during the shift.

If a sentence is 20 minutes or longer, allow the prisoner access to the
communal jail area and not confine them to the cell except in cases of
suicide attempts <s>or if their "cell" happens to be the interior of the
arresting officer</s>.

If further criminal acts are made while imprisoned (such as assaulting
another prisoner or breaking windows), the prisoner is to be moved to
solitary confinement with charges added to their sentence.

If prison time for a single holding accumulates to more than 90 minutes,
hold the prisoner until judgement by a tribunal.

<sub>((\ On\ laggy\ games\ first\ take\ a\ look\ at\ how\ quickly\ the\ cell\ timers\ tick.\ We\ don't\ want\ people\ to\ spend\ an\ eternity\ in\ jail\ just\ for\ stealing\ a\ pair\ of\ gloves.\ ))</sub>

### Low Level Infractions

These infractions carry standard punishments of up to around 10 minutes,
and can be set with an officer's discretion. 'Suggested Sentence' values
are beside the incidents. 'Additional Penalties' can be decided by
authorization of Colony Director, Head of Security, or equivalent (if no
HoS or Director are present, then a vote of heads of staff is
sufficient. Failing that, the warden. Otherwise, contact Central
Command), and do not require tribunals. At the officer's discretion,
they may offer community service in place of the sentences below.

Because most of these sentences offer fines, you normally won't even
bother bringing the offender to Security unless they refuse to pay the
fine. If they pay the fine (or carry out community services as an
alternative offered at the HoS's discretion), no jail time is to be
given. You won't even need to take them to Security for processing.

### Medium Level Infractions

These Infractions carry standard punishments of up to 30 minutes, though
typically around 10-15 minutes, and can be set with an officer's
discretion. 'Suggested Sentence' values are beside the Infractions.

Refusing handcuffs *and* refusing to come to the brig *is* resisting arrest. So is pushing the officer trying to arrest you, or running away. Simply not showing up to the brig when asked doesn't count. Actively hiding or running away is what this law is for. Take into account their reason for not reporting to security immediately as well. For example, a Chief Engineer trying to stop the engine from exploding probably shouldn't be charged with resisting arrest if they ignore the fact that security wants to give them a vandalism fine for breaking a wall earlier. Likewise, if anyone in security has threatened them with *harm*, not just arrest, they're somewhat justified in hiding. | 10 minutes.                                                                                                      | Up to 20 minutes.                                                         |

### High Severity Infractions

These Infractions generally need to be ruled on by a tribunal as
explained by [further
below](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations#Legal_Standard_Operating_Procedure "wikilink"),
and criminals should be held until judgement can be passed. In a few
severe circumstances, [permanent removal](/wiki/Permanent_Death "wikilink")
from the station may occur.

| ยง401 | **Inducement** | To intentionally provoke, bribe, trick, or incite a crew member to commit a crime they otherwise would not have with the intention of getting them arrested. | Examples include (but are not limited to) a Security officer acting in an unprofessional manner and then attempting to press "insulting an officer on duty" charges on a crew member that lose their temper at such treatment, bribing an engineer to break into a place and retrieve objects, tricking a crew member into rage to attack another crew member or simply provoking a crew member until they attack, just to claim self defense afterwards. Likewise, security officers that threaten suspects with physical violence then try to charge them with resisting arrest when they flee or fight back.

### Commentaries and Clarifications

-   **Community Service**: For low-level crimes, at the officer's
    discretion, they may offer community service as an alternative to
    the standard penalties. If the suspect elects to carry out the
    offered task, then the normal sentence is waived. Community Service
    is at the discretion of the officer, and may be something as simple
    as "fix the mess you made" for a vandalism charge, to "replace that
    lunch you stole <s>with yourself</s>". There is no *specific* limit
    on what may be appropriate for community service, but officers who
    offer something *too* punitive shouldn't be surprised if prisoners
    just elect to take the custodial sentence instead.
-   **Cyborgification** The removal of a person's brain for
    transplanting into a Cyborg Chassis as an alternative to execution.
    A prisoner who is sentenced to execution must request or consent to
    this.
-   **Dismissal**: Changing ID title to "Dismissed", which has zero
    access. Requires the judgement of the prisoner's head of staff or
    the Colony Director to be valid.
-   **Demotion**: Can be demoted down to and including Assistant
    position. Requires the judgement of the prisoner's head of staff or
    the Colony Director to be valid.
-   **Employee**: Employee of NanoTrasen, as defined by the station's
    commanding officer. All non-employee subjects are not protected by
    these laws.
-   **Empowering**: Illegal acquiring (not via Head of Personnel or
    Colony Director) of access.
-   **Execution**: Prisoner is killed via means of firing squad, lethal
    injection, or [some other means](/wiki/Guide_to_Vore "wikilink"). It is
    required for the Colony Director to be present (and not an Acting
    Colony Director), or an execution may not proceed. It is required to
    offer the prisoner the option of how they prefer to die. They should
    also be offered a last meal. It is not required to follow these
    preferences if they are deemed unreasonable or impossible. In all
    cases of execution, [Central Command](/wiki/Central_Command "wikilink")
    should be informed of the execution and the crimes leading up to it.
    (( A PK may be applicable in this situation. See [Permanent
    Death](/wiki/Permanent_Death "wikilink") for OOC details. ))
-   **Head of Staff**: Crew members occupying one of the following
    positions: Colony Director, Chief Engineer, Head of Personnel, Head
    of Security, Chief Medical Officer, Research Director.
-   **Imminent Peril**: A situation in which there is an apparent and
    immediate threat of serious injury or death, and it is not possible
    to escape this threat. Obvious examples are shooting someone trying
    to stab people. A less obvious example is shooting someone trying to
    sabotage Atmospherics. Lethal force is justified in such a situation
    because there's no other options remaining.
-   **HuJ / Holding Until Judgement**: Held (in the brig) until a
    tribunal is done, or the shift ends. Whichever happens first.
-   **HuT / Holding Until Transfer**: Held (in the brig) until the shift
    ends. This becomes HuJ when a tribunal is being held for the
    prisoner.
-   **Severe Injury**: A state in which the victim is in a critical
    condition and is having difficulty maintaining consciousness.

Demotion and dismissal also require the removal of equipment from the
previous job. Uniforms, weapons, bombs, PDA cartridges, etc.

For the purposes of Cyborg/AI laws, crew members that have been
convicted, or are being held in detention, are considered to be below
even the AI/Cyborgs in terms of rank.

Serving sentences in jail can be replaced with forced labor in some
cases.

In cases where the final sentence is more than 90 minutes, it is changed
to holding until judgement.

The standard penalty can be applied without a tribunal by Security
Officers.

Penalties listed here are guidelines. Tribunals can assign lesser or
higher ones, depending on the circumstances.

### Legal Standard Operating Procedure

Tribunals are the main way major decisions are made aboard the station
There are not often lawyers, and the defendant does not have to be
involved. There is not specified length for how long a tribunal must be.
The AI may be called in as a replacement Head of Staff if there are not
sufficient numbers, and it can be trusted to be accurate. Basically it's
the same as the old trial, but without a jury and slightly streamlined.

-   **Purpose:** For crimes or decisions that require more than one
    person, or crimes where there is no set punishment.

<!-- -->

-   **Overview:** Three to Six Heads of Staff must discuss this issue
    and vote on the outcome.

<!-- -->

-   **Process:** The Colony Director or acting Colony Director should
    call the Heads of Staff for a tribunal with the situation and
    proposed outcome. This can be done formally in a meeting room, or
    informally over radio.

<!-- -->

-   **Conviction:** The tribunal must vote on the outcome, and the
    outcome must win by a majority vote (over 50%). If there is a tie,
    the Colony Director's vote wins.

<!-- -->

-   **Sentencing:** If the vote passes, the outcome may be enacted,
    usually by Security. The decision can be appealed once by either the
    defendant or the Colony Director.

OOC Notes
---------

-   It's vital to know that the involvement of CentCom means involvement
    of admins. However, if that happens, admins will try to keep in
    character. Ergo, the character is **not** going to magically know
    attack logs or fingerprints or anything else they don't know IC,
    because it's like playing a game with cheat codes. It's fun to screw
    off for a little while, but then it's going to get really boring.
    -   The above also applies in the case of admins playing normal
        Security.
    -   The only exception to the above is in the case of potentially
        removing a character from the station. See [Permanent
        Death](/wiki/Permanent_Death "wikilink") for details. Admins are not
        going to PK someone who they know OOCly didn't actually do the
        crime.
-   **Corporate Regulations <u>ARE NOT RULES</u> for the server its
    self!** That means, so long as you have a believable in-character
    motive for breaking these regulations, you won't get banned for it,
    especially if [vore](vore "wikilink") is your end goal. Conversely,
    if you're just going around smashing windows for shits and giggles,
    you're *obviously* going to get yelled at by an admin. See [the
    actual server rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink") for more details.
