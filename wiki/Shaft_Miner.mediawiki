Welcome, '''Shaft Miner''', to the wonderful caverns of this [[Mining Station|NanoTrasen Claimed Asteroid]].

=== Your Boss ===
Your superiors are the Head of Personnel, and then the Quartermaster. Generally they won't butt into any of your affairs other than talking over the cargo channel and (if they know what they're doing) attempting to coordinate your efforts for the good of the station.

=== Chatting it Up ===
You can talk with all of your mining buddies, as well as the other cargo technicians and the all-important Quartermaster, over the Supply channel using ''':u''' or :h.

== The Objective ==
{{Main|Guide to Mining}}
You're here to mine, so get digging! Put on your mining hard-suit (make sure to put a large oxygen tank in your suit storage), check your [[internals]], and cycle yourself out the airlock. Then grab your drill in one hand, click on an ore tile, and pick up the ore with your mining satchel. You can then empty the satchel into an Ore Box, so it's probably best to drag one around with you.

If you prefer heavy machinery, you can use a [[Guide to Mining#Drill 101|mining drill]] to dig into the asteroid for you. This is the only way to get hydrogen.

Once you're full to bursting with ores, drag your crate to the conveyor belt outside of the airlock. From there, you can use the machines and computers to [[Guide to Mining#Furnace 101|smelt raw ore to its finished state]] and stack them up to 50-count piles. From there, it's off to wherever those resources need to be, but hopefully you have a [[Cargo Technician]] for that. Back to the mines!

Details on how do to your job can be found in the [[Guide to Mining]].

=== Who Needs What ===
* [[Scientist]]s want a little silver, gold, phoron, uranium, diamond, and solid hydrogen. Refine a little of each for research (5-10 blocks each should do it; 2-5 for the diamond and hydrogen). In exchange, they may give you more advanced mining tools (like a sonic jackhammer), for even faster digging. 
* [[Roboticist]]s need metal, plasteel, diamond, uranium, silver and gold for building mech parts. Give them enough and you might get a big, fancy machine for your troubles! The Ripley is the best mech for mining.
* Everybody could always use more metal and glass, but especially [[Station Engineer]]s.

== Traitoring ==
A traitorous miner has a lot of advantages. You have a space suit for free right away and your mining tools are pretty good weapons. As long as you have some mineral wealth on you, no one will suspect your presence around the station, even in highly restricted areas like robotics or toxins. In addition, the mining station is isolated, hard to get to, and as expansive as you're willing to dig out. Plenty of room for somebody to get lost in... ''Forever!''
