The **Scientist** is one of the most feared and fun jobs on station.
Being a scientist means you can make and test a large number of tools
and gadgets through research, construct highly explosive bombs, or study
dangerous alien life forms.

The Laboratories
----------------

#### Research & Development

This lab houses the development of hi-tech devices including weapons,
batteries, drills, and circuit boards.

Items around the station such as the hand teleporter, stun batons and
analyzers can be collected used to improve research tech levels.

Your research efforts will cap at a certain point without minerals from
mining. Co-ordinate with the [Quartermaster](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink")
or the [Shaft Miners](/wiki/Shaft_Miner "wikilink") themselves to get the
minerals you need.

For a more in-depth guide, see the [Guide to Research and
Development](/wiki/Guide_to_Research_and_Development "wikilink").

#### Toxins Research

Toxins Mixing is where you spawn.

This lab focuses on exploring the possibilities of plasma gas, typically
in the form of massive explosions. Also provided to you is the [Toxins
Test Chamber](/wiki/Toxins_Test_Chamber "wikilink") (AKA Bomb Range).
Hopefully, this is where you will be testing your bombs.

Bomb making is not all that easy though, as the Toxins Research Lab is
really prone to outbursts of plasma, fire, plasma that's on fire, or
even plasma that's on fire and spreading N2O. Yep, it ain't easy being a
scientist.

For more information, refer to the [Guide to
Toxins](/wiki/Guide_to_Toxins "wikilink").

#### Xenoarcheology and Anomaly study

You can get here from the research shuttle.

This whole place is focused on finding and excavating artifacts from the
asteroid, and if you're really lucky: To experiment on large anomalous
artifacts you may find while out on a dig. Worse comes to worse, you can
also play the role of a second-hand shaft miner, but you still need at
least a [Quartermaster](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink") on staff.

For more information, refer to the [Guide to
Xenoarchaeology](/wiki/Guide_To_Xenoarchaeology "wikilink")

#### Xenobiology

This laboratory specializes in the the study of alien lifeforms, such as
[slimes](slime "wikilink") and sometimes
[xenomorphs](xenomorph "wikilink").

Careful handling and caution if this lab is advised as it is common for
untrained personnel to inadvertently release the specimen. It is
important to make sure your flock is fed, and any extra unneeded slimes
culled to keep them from getting out of hand, it's also important to
make sure adult slimes are fed enough to split, or they'll make a mess
of their pens... Or you! Experiment on all sorts of fancy cores.

Xenobiology](/wiki/Guide_to_Xenobiology "wikilink")

Tips
----

-   ***Unless you're a traitor, don't use the bombs on the main station.
    You'll get banned otherwise.***
-   Always warn the station before your detonate a bomb. Your resident
    Tajarans will be less likely to claw off your face and more likely
    to help you fix the inevitable damage to Toxins if you do.
-   Change the frequency of the remote signalling devices so that other
    scientists or saboteurs don't set off your explosives themselves.
-   You can open your PDA, minimize the new window, and leave your PDA
    in your pocket so that you can set off your bombs as long as you
    don't need to change the frequency. Whenever it's time for an
    explosion you just open the window you minimized, click send signal,
    and it'll do it!
-   Always make sure you have at least one grey slime core on hand
    in-case of a sudden and unexpected loss of slime life.

Traitoring
----------

It's possible to make bombs that utterly destroy a small area, gib only
those people next to you, explode when you die, bring general ruin to
entire wings of the station, and more! It is recommended that you use
your traitor points on things to conceal your identity, or get a space
suit for those 'accidents'. Protolathed objects and slime cores can make
fore interesting weapons as well.

Moreover, your access to signalers unleashes a whole new world of
possibility, remotely triggering weird behavior in electronic equipment,
putting anyone off your track. Cameras, airlocks , protolathes, air
alarms, mulebots; you name it!

Xenoarcheology is also a great source for weaponry, nothing says awesome
like wielding a katana and going on a killing spree, if you're lucky,
you may even find a loaded alien gun!
