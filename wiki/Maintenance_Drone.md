So you signed up to be a drone, eh? Unlike other servers, drones do not
have access to the cameras. Better memorize the vent layout! You have
laws against interaction with the crew, as well as improving the
station. If there are no breaches, work in any area, improving it, by
changing flooring, etc, so long as it doesn't interfere with the crew's
working. If you wanted to, you could TECHNICALLY build your own station
on the same Z-Level. Though why would
[anyone](index.php?title=Traitor&action=edit&redlink=1 "wikilink") want
to do that?
