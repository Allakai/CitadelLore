Deconstruction is easy. Simply stick items into the destructive analyzer
and turn it on. It is possible to eject items from the deconstructive
analyzer if, say, security notices their missing Jugde revolvers. As
always, experiment! Some technology on the station is just so basic that
the analyzer won't even bother with it, but things like bruise packs,
flashbangs, and some of the odds and ends in your very lab will all
work.

The funny thing is that you can get all levels of research (Materials,
Power, etc.) as high as 5 or higher, only using components found in your
lab, and your prolathe/circuit imprinter. You don't even have to leave
your lab. You just have to find how.

List of Destructible Items
==========================

You'll only advance one level at a time per item, and only if the tech
level is equal or greater than your current research level. Higher
research levels will allow additional items to be created using the
[Protolathe](/wiki/Protolathe "wikilink") and [Circuit
Imprinter](/wiki/Circuit_Imprinter "wikilink").

Deconstruction is easy. Simply stick items into the destructive analyzer
and turn it on. It is possible to eject items from the deconstructive
analyzer if, say, security notices their missing laser guns. As always,
experiment! Some technology on the station is just so basic that the
analyzer won't even bother with it, but things like bruise packs,
flashbangs, and some of the odds and ends in your very lab will all
work.

The Destructive analyzer can be
[upgraded](/wiki/Research_Director#Upgrading_the_station "wikilink");
improving it.
