The **Search and Rescue** (SAR) role is a rather new addition to medical
that is essentially a long range paramedic, focusing on retrieving and
saving people **off station,** and not necessarily the crew on station,
as that is a job for [Paramedics](/wiki/Paramedic "wikilink"). As a SAR, you
will most likely be deploying on a shuttle piloted by the
[Pilot](/wiki/Pilot "wikilink") along with [Explorers](Explorer "wikilink") to
particular waypoints to perform your duties.

Setup
-----

<small><i>This will be taken from the [Paramedic](/wiki/Paramedic "wikilink")
page. Please view that page for more info.</i></small>

SARs will need equipment necessary for rescuing, stabilizing, and
sustaining someone long enough to endure the trip from the operation
area all the way back to the Tether facility. Below is a good loadout to
use.

-   ![](PGlasses.png "fig:PGlasses.png") A pair of [AR-M
    glasses](/wiki/Medical_Items#AR-M "wikilink") to get an estimate of
    someone's health from a glance, check their records, and view suit
    sensors.
-   ![](LGloves.png "fig:LGloves.png") A pair of [latex or nitrile
    gloves](/wiki/Medical_Items#Latex_Gloves "wikilink") to prevent spreading
    infection.
-   ![](BreathMask.png "fig:BreathMask.png") An internals mask for
    waypoints with inevitably harsh atmosphere.
-   ![](Parachute.png "fig:Parachute.png") A parachute to safely drop
    onto a planet's surface without turning into a pancake.
-   ![](Medical_Hardsuit.png "fig:Medical_Hardsuit.png") A
    [voidsuit](/wiki/Medical_Items#Medical_Voidsuit "wikilink") assembled and
    ready.
-   <img src="GPS.gif" title="fig:GPS.gif" alt="GPS.gif" width="32" /> A
    GPS tracker to allow others to track your exact coordinates and
    allows you to track other GPS signals.
-   ![](Beacon.png "fig:Beacon.png") A marker beacon that emits some
    light. Works like a breadcrumb.
-   ![](Healthanalyzer.png "fig:Healthanalyzer.png") A [health
    analyzer](/wiki/Medical_Items#Health_Analyzer "wikilink") for basic but
    *very* necessary diagnosis of injuries.
-   ![](Syringes.png "fig:Syringes.png") A
    [syringe](/wiki/Medical_Items#Syringes "wikilink") to extract reagents
    from bottles to administer to the patient quickly.
-   ![](Medicalbelt.png "fig:Medicalbelt.png") A [medical
    belt](/wiki/Medical_Items#Medical_Belt "wikilink") to store your
    medicines, normally bottles.
-   ![](WWebbing.png "fig:WWebbing.png") A [webbing vest/drop
    pouches](/wiki/Medical_Items#Webbing/Drop_Pouches "wikilink") to store
    more medical items, if not exploration gear.
-   ![](Bottles.gif "fig:Bottles.gif") [Bicaridine, KeloDerm/Dermaline,
    Dylovene, Dexalin Plus, and
    Inaprovaline](/wiki/Guide_to_Chemistry#Medicine "wikilink") bottles - with
    caps off - to draw from to stabilize and treat basic injuries.
-   ![](AMed.png "fig:AMed.png") An [advanced
    kit](/wiki/Medical_Items#Advanced_Medical_Kit "wikilink") placed in your
    backpack.
-   ![](Rollerbed.png "fig:Rollerbed.png") A [roller
    bed](/wiki/Medical_Items#Roller_Bed "wikilink") to transport patients
    quickly without dragging. Toss it in your backpack.
-   ![](Stasis_Bag.png "fig:Stasis_Bag.png") A [stasis
    bag](/wiki/Medical_Items#Stasis_Bag "wikilink") to slow the progression of
    injuries. Take a few of these.

Locating Distress Signals
-------------------------

**PLACEHOLDER. FILL IN LATER.**

Extraction
----------

You've found someone injured. What do you do?

1.  Gauge the situation. Do the current surroundings or circumstances
    put the patient in danger?
    -   If so, move patient somewhere safe, or back to the ship. Then...
2.  Scan the patient's injuries. Take everything into account (yes, even
    high temperature is a symptom of certain ailments).
3.  Treat the patient to the best of your ability until they can be
    evaluated back in medbay.
    -   If they are critical with life threatening injuries, stasis them
        once the ship takes off for the Tether, no sooner and no later
        unless the situation demands it.
    -   The reasoning behind this is because stasis bags have a limited
        air supply, and only slow down the progression of injuries
        instead of stopping them.
4.  Deliver patient to medical and allow [Medical
    Doctors](/wiki/Medical_Doctor "wikilink") to take care of it.

Off The Clock
-------------

<s>[Pilot](/wiki/Pilot "wikilink") is missing or just doesn't want to fly you
around? Then double up as a [Paramedic](/wiki/Paramedic "wikilink") for the
time being, helping out around the station while you wait to deploy. You
are medical, after all, why not assist the other staff? Perhaps even ask
the other staff to counsel you on a good loadout.</s> You can help
medical before and after the expedition, but if there is an active
Paramedic you shouldn't be doing their job for them. When in doubt ask
the CMO but don't forget job hijacking is against the
[rules](rules "wikilink")!

Roleplay Tips
-------------

-   Search and Rescue involves going into many situations that you don't
    have any beforehand knowledge of, most of them probably being quite
    dangerous in the end. You probably have a fair bit of experience
    given you've survived for so long.
-   Alternatively, you may play a character who is totally new to this
    line of work, unsure what to expect but keeping an open mind to
    learn.
-   <s>You could probably *search and rescue* crew from bellies or
    something.</s>
