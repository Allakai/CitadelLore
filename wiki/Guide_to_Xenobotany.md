A Xenobotanist is a [Scientist](/wiki/Scientist "wikilink") who works to
determine and manipulate the genetics of plants in space. A xenobotanist
works in [Xenoflora](/wiki/Xenoflora "wikilink").

Genetics
--------

Plants have twelve genes, labelled and ordered at random each round.
Each gene represents a set of traits from the plant. These include:

-   **Biochemistry**: Which reagents the fruit contains; which gases the
    plant generates.
-   **Hardiness**: Endurance. Tolerance to toxins, pests, and weeds.
-   **Environment**: Plant's preferred temperature and light levels, and
    how much tolerance it has for changes in light level.
-   **Metabolism**: Whether the plant requires water or fertilizer.
    Whether it alters the ambient temperature.
-   **Appearance**: Unused.
-   **Diet**: Whether the plant consumes gases in its environment;
    whether the plant is carnivorous (eats pests) or eats tray weeds;
    how much water and fertilizer it consumes.
-   **Pigment**: The color of the plant and its fruit; the color of any
    bioluminescence.
-   **Output**: Whether the plant produces electrical power or
    bioluminescent light.
-   **Atmosphere**: The plant's tolerance for changes in temperature and
    pressure away from its preferred levels.
-   **Vigour**: How long the plant takes to mature and produce fruit.
    How much fruit it produces. Whether it can spread out of its tray.
-   **Fruit**: Whether the fruit is juicy and will splatter when thrown;
    whether the plant has stinging spines and will inject its reagents
    into anyone coming in contact with it.
-   **Special**: The ability to teleport the thrower or target when
    thrown.

A gene label from any given plant represents the same trait across all
plants; in other words, if gene F6 represents products for tomatoes, it
will also represent products from ambrosia.

Lysis-isolation Centrifuge
--------------------------

This piece of machinery accepts a seed packet or cutting as well as a
data disk. When used to scan a seed, it destroys the seed in order to
reclaim its genetic information, which can be loaded onto a data disk a
certain number of times before the stored genome degrades completely.

Bioballistic Delivery System
----------------------------

When loaded with a data disk and a seed, this machine is used to apply
the gene stored on the data disk to the loaded packet. It will overwrite
the corresponding gene on the target packet. Seeds can only be
overwritten a certain number of times before they degrade completely and
can no longer be modified.

How to Modify Seeds
-------------------

-   Identify your genes.
    -   Pick two plants whose genes are very different from each other.
        Since all the plants from the seed vendors have the same
        Resistance, Environment, and Consumption genes, it helps if one
        of the plants is an exotic seed that you've planted and
        harvested more seed packets from, either through tasking
        cuttings or by extracting seeds from fruit. If you don't have
        exotic seeds, you can mutate an existing species to have genes
        that are different.
    -   Have three or four identical seed packets from each species.
    -   Using the lysis-isolation centrifuge, add a seed packet from
        Species 1. Analyze the genome (this will destroy the seed
        packet!). Then add a flora data disk to the centrifuge and copy
        each gene onto the disk. Eventually, the genetic information in
        the lysis-isolation centrifuge will be exhausted, and you'll
        need to add and analyze another Species 1 seed packet. Repeat
        this until you have a disk for each of the twelve genes.
    -   Using your plant analyzer, analyze Species 2 and make a note of
        its characteristics.
    -   Put a seed packet from Species 2 into the bioballistic delivery
        system. Add one of your flora data disks with genes from Species
        1, and apply the modification.
    -   Eject the seed packet and analyze it again with the plant
        analyzer. Note which gene has changed. For example, if the plant
        from Species 2 now has a trait from Species 1, you know that's
        the trait you have transferred, and that that's the gene on the
        disk.
    -   Label your disk with the gene, or make a note of which gene is
        which.
    -   Repeat this with the other five disks, each time making a note
        of which gene is which. If the modified plant doesn't change at
        all, it's likely that you've transferred a gene that is
        identical in Species 1 and Species 2--usually the Flowers gene.
        Eventually, modifying any given seed packet will no longer be
        viable; the machine will tell you when that happens. You'll have
        to switch to a new seed packet.
-   Now that you have your genes identified, think about which genes you
    want to transfer from which plant to which. Typically, with exotic
    seeds, you'll want to make them viable for growing on the station.
    -   Vigor is a good gene to transfer to plants that grow or produce
        fruit slowly. Choose a plant which produces fruit quickly or in
        large quantities and transfer the Vigor gene to the exotic
        plant. Vigor genes from a plant that doesn't grow kudzu-style
        can be transferred to one that does, to make these plants more
        manageable. (Or you could transfer the kudzu vigor gene to a
        non-spreading plant; we're not judging here.)
    -   Environment genes from station-adapted plants will help the
        target plant to grow on the station.
    -   Consumption genes from plants that are particularly frugal, or
        which can eat weeds or pests, can be transferred to plants that
        don't.
    -   Resistance genes from resistant plants can be transferred to
        plants that are vulnerable to pests, toxins, or weeds.
    -   Bioluminescence can be transferred from one plant to another via
        the Flowers gene.
    -   The Products gene is special: Instead of replacing the gene on
        the target plant, it's added in. Your target plant will now
        produce two types of fruit, one from the source and the other
        from the target, and each fruit will contain chemicals from both
        fruit types. However, transferring a Products gene will result
        in a generally less vigorous plant with less potent fruit.

Dangerous Plants
----------------

### Taming Kudzu

Kudzu, and other spreading vines, will spread from their tray into the
lab. Given time and open doors, a vine plant could spread throughout the
station. It will also entangle people who step into an area with thick
growth, and may inject any chemicals from its fruit into the people it
has entangled. Garden-variety kudzu isn't so dangerous; the dylovene it
contains is not toxic. But beware the vine which contains cyanide.

To control a spreading vine:

-   Before you plant, modify a vine-type plant by splicing in a Vigor
    gene from a plant that doesn't spread.
-   Plant a vine-type plant in the isolation area of the Xenoflora lab.
-   A hatchet can cut down vines more quickly than most tools.
-   Plant-b-gone and other chemicals that kill plants can also kill
    vines.
-   A goat will eat vine plants quickly and effectively (but is also
    ornery enough to bite you). Order one from Cargo.
-   If the plant injects something poisonous, don't be where the vines
    are. Borgs are safe from poisonous substances.
-   If the plant has the trait that makes it very carnivorous, it will
    drain blood from people it captures in its vines. Once again, don't
    be where the vines are.

### Atmospheric Hazards

Some exotic plants emit gases ranging from nitrogen to phoron. Some of
these gases are dangerous only when the plant has created so much of
them that the pressure in the room is dangerously high; others are
dangerous even in small quantities.

To grow a plant that produces gas:

-   Always plant unknown exotic plants in an isolation tray connected to
    a port.
-   Your PDA includes an atmospheric scanner. Pull it up and monitor the
    air to detect gas-producing plants before you're unconscious or
    poisoned.
-   If a plant produces gas, toggle the tray lid on the tray. This will
    isolate the tray, but it may not be the kind of environment the
    plant likes. Plants grown in isolation trays with the lids up will
    need careful tending and a lot of diethylamine.
-   Call for Atmospherics if the problem has gotten bad enough to
    contaminate the room (an atmos alarm panel flashing orange or red).
-   If you were exposed to Phoron gas, leave the room immediately,
    decontaminate and get to Medical.

Tips and tricks
---------------

-   Your general purpose as a Xenobotanist is to find out which gene
    mask corresponds to which trait and use this info to make bizarre
    mutant plants.
-   You can click a disk in hand to clear the contents and reuse it. You
    have a limited number so keep an eye on them. More can be ordered
    from cargo.
-   Plants have varied traits. Using a given plant to isolate a specific
    trait may be worthwhile (ie. kudzu for spread, poppies for flowers).
-   Other traits should be fairly easy to find (product trait will cause
    the target to grow extra fruits, etc).
