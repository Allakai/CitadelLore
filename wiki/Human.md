Modern **humans** (*Homo sapiens*) are the only extant members of the
subtribe Hominina, a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the
family of great apes. They are a space-faring species hailing originally
from the planet [Earth](/wiki/Earth "wikilink") in the [Sol](Sol "wikilink")
system. They are currently among the most numerous known species in the
galaxy, in both population and holdings, and are relatively
technologically advanced.

Humanity is the primary driving force for rapid space expansion, owing
to their strong, expansionist [central
government](/wiki/Sol_Central "wikilink") and opportunistic [Trans-Stellar
Corporations](/wiki/Trans-Stellar_Corporations "wikilink"). The
[USDF](/wiki/USDF "wikilink"), which is the military arm of SolGov, has become
a major force on the galactic stage as well. The prejudices of the 21st
century have mostly given way to bitter divides on the most important
issue of the times; technological expansionism, with some major human
factions squabbling over their approach to technology in the face of a
looming technological singularity.

While most humans have accepted the existence of aliens in their
communities and workplaces as a fact of life,
[some](/wiki/Nazi_Remnant "wikilink") [exceptions](Soviet_Union "wikilink")
still exist. While more culturally diverse than most species, humans are
generally regarded as somewhat technophobic and isolationist by members
of other species.

Overview
========

-   Humans have their own language, Sol Common, which you can speak by
    typing `#1`
-   Due to how most technology in human-controlled space was made for
    humans in mind, they can wear most clothing, and even wear some
    specialized space suits designed for [other
    species](/wiki/Skrell "wikilink").
-   Humans have no species wide restriction on diet, where as other
    species might.
-   Humans are not barred from certain jobs, such as [Heads of
    Staff](/wiki/Job_Guides#Heads_of_Staff "wikilink") or [Internal
    Affairs](/wiki/Internal_Affairs "wikilink"), as
    [NanoTrasen](/wiki/NanoTrasen "wikilink") is a human-run company, after
    all.

Biology
-------

![](Human.png "fig:Human.png") The most commonly defined body systems in
humans are the nervous, the cardiovascular, the circulatory, the
digestive, the endocrine, the immune, the integumentary, the lymphatic,
the musculoskeletal, the reproductive, the respiratory, and the urinary
system.

Humans, like most of the other apes, lack external tails, have several
blood type systems, have opposable thumbs, and are sexually dimorphic.
Humans are also among the best long-distance runners in the galactic
animal kingdom, but slower over short distances. Humans' thinner body
hair and more productive sweat glands help avoid heat exhaustion while
running for long distances. Humans have about 2 million sweat glands
spread over their entire bodies.

It is estimated that the average height for an adult human male is about
172 cm (5 ft 7 1⁄2 in), while the worldwide average height for adult
human females is about 158 cm (5 ft 2 in). Shrinkage of stature may
begin in middle age in some individuals, but tends to be typical in the
extremely aged. Through history human populations have universally
become taller, probably as a consequence of better nutrition,
healthcare, and living conditions. The average mass of an adult human is
54–76 kg (119–168 lb). Like many other conditions, body weight and body
type is influenced by genetic susceptibility, environment,
[diet](/wiki/Vore "wikilink"), and it varies greatly among individuals.

Although humans appear hairless, with notable hair growth occurring
chiefly on the top of the head, underarms and pubic area, the average
human has more hair follicles on his or her body than the average
chimpanzee. The main distinction is that human hairs are shorter, finer,
and less heavily pigmented than a chimpanzee's, thus making them harder
to see.

### Reproduction

As with other mammals, human reproduction takes place as internal
fertilization by sexual intercourse. During this process, the male
inserts his erect penis into the female's vagina and ejaculates semen,
which contains sperm. The sperm travels through the vagina and cervix
into the uterus or Fallopian tubes for fertilization of the ovum. Upon
fertilization and implantation, gestation then occurs within the
female's uterus.

The zygote divides inside the female's uterus to become an embryo, which
over a period of 38 weeks (9 months) of gestation becomes a fetus. After
this span of time, the fully grown fetus is birthed from the woman's
body and breathes independently as an infant for the first time. At this
point, most modern cultures recognize the baby as a person entitled to
the full protection of the law, though some jurisdictions extend various
levels of personhood earlier to human fetuses while they remain in the
uterus.

Compared with other species, human childbirth is dangerous. Painful
labors lasting 24 hours or more are not uncommon and sometimes lead to
the death of the mother, the child or both. This is because of both the
relatively large fetal head circumference and the mother's relatively
narrow pelvis. The chances of a successful labor increased significantly
during the 20th and 21st centuries with the advent of new medical
technologies. In contrast, pregnancy and natural childbirth remain
hazardous ordeals in developing regions of the galaxy, with maternal
death rates approximately 100 times greater than in developed systems.

Humans are considerably helpless at birth, and will continue to grow for
some years, typically reaching sexual maturity at 12 to 15 years of age.
Females continue to develop physically until around the age of 18,
whereas male development continues until around age 21. The human life
span can be split into a number of stages: infancy, childhood,
adolescence, young adulthood, adulthood and old age.

### Gender Differences

The most obvious differences between males and females include all the
features related to reproductive role, notably the endocrine (hormonal)
systems and their physiological and behavioral effects, including
gonadal differentiation, internal and external genital and breast
differentiation, and differentiation of muscle mass, height, and hair
distribution.

Externally, the most sexually dimorphic portions of the human body are
the chest, the lower half of the face, and the area between the waist
and the knees. Males often weigh slightly more than females, and are
also slightly taller. On average, men also have a larger waist in
comparison to their hips than women. Women however have a larger hip
section than men; an adaptation for giving birth to infants with large
skulls. Women also usually have substantially larger breasts due to the
presence of milk-producing mammary glands.

The sexual division of humans into male and female has been marked
culturally by a corresponding division of roles, norms, practices,
dress, behavior, rights, duties, privileges, status, and power. Cultural
differences by gender have often been believed to have arisen naturally
out of a division of reproductive labor; the biological fact that women
give birth led to their further cultural responsibility for nurturing
and caring for children. Gender roles have varied historically, and
challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.

### Lifespan

With good healthcare and a reasonable lifestyle, a human can live to
around 110 years. The oldest known humans are around 150 years old.

### Diet

Humans are omnivores, and have evolved to be able to handle a wide
variety of foods. However, even humans cannot safely ingest large
quantities chemicals that are almost universally toxic to other species,
like cyanide, phoron, ethanol, or heavy metals.

Strangely, some humans even take pleasure in consuming foods with
certain toxins, such as capscain, or other toxins that induce a
sensation of burning, numbness, sourness, etc, despite the discomfort
and sometimes even extreme agony that results from consuming such foods.
Scientists believe these seemingly self-destructive habits were born out
of necessity, due to an abundance of vitamins present in spicy/sour
foods.

Demi-humans (Splicers)
----------------------

Some humans (or their ancestors) have undergone genetic augmentation to
combine animal DNA with their own through a procedure known as
**Splicing**. These humans were originally referred to as *Splicers*,
but because of the word's xenophobic connotations, the phrase
**demi-humans** is the preferred modern term referring to individuals
who have undergone splicing, or are descended from such individuals.

The procedure was invented during the late 21st century, then quickly
outlawed by the United Earth Government. The act of splicing resulted in
humans gaining certain abilities or cosmetic features normally found
within select animals. These abilities commonly included traits such as
enhanced strength, prolonged lifespans, cosmetic changes (such as cat
ears), <s>the ability to unhinge one's jaw and swallow a person
whole,</s> enhanced low-lighting vision, healing abilities, alterations
to metabolism, and more. These individuals usually maintained the
ability to breed, and passed on many of these traits to their offspring.
Splicing remained illegal within SolGov space until the 26th century
when SolGov was contacted by the [United
Federation](/wiki/United_Federation "wikilink") in
[2501](/wiki/Timeline "wikilink"). Intense lobbying and the offer of an
alliance with the Federation pushed SolGov to repeal centuries-old
legislation against the practice.

Communities of demi-humans exist scattered across the galaxy because of
[Project Jasher](/wiki/Project_Jasher "wikilink"), though the most notable
community of demi-humans exists within the United Federation.

Today, splicing is common and legal but still prohibitively expensive
procedure. Most splicing is still performed by unsanctioned biogenetic
engineers.

Behavior
========

Humanity's behavior varies immensely from system to system. Social
norms, the often-unspoken rules of a group, shape not just the behaviors
of humans, but also their attitudes. An individual's behavior varies
depending on the group(s) they are a part of. Humans who have been
adopted by other species will often adopt the mannerisms of a foster
parent and the society surrounding them, even to the extent of
subconsciously mimicking speech and accents. Humans are also very
capable of learning and comprehending other languages, so long as they
are within a human's range of hearing. Humans thrive on knowledge, much
like the [Skrell](/wiki/Skrell "wikilink").

However, unlike any other species in the known galaxy, even more than
[Sergals](/wiki/Sergal "wikilink"), or [Unathi](/wiki/Unathi "wikilink"), almost
every one of humanity's major technological advancements have been
fundamentally based in the need to conduct war. The very advent of space
travel was a product made not of a desire to explore, but as a means to
demonstrate their military superiority over other rivaling nations on
Earth. As such, humanity's core military, the [USDF](/wiki/USDF "wikilink"),
is arguably the most powerful military force in the known galaxy.
Despite a lag in technology behind some other species, such as the
[Skrell](/wiki/Skrell "wikilink"), humanity makes up for it with a knack for
grand strategy and asymmetric warfare. Unlike other races, humans very
much continue to be at war with other humans as old grudges survive to
the modern day. The fighting is of such severity and ferocity that it
arguably cannot be compared to the political quarrels of Skrellian
city-states, despite other similarities.

Humans are unpredictable in how they'll respond to contact with alien
species, though this largely depends on societal and economic factors
that vary immensely with each population. Some humans will greet aliens
as if they were just like any other human, even to the extent of forming
deep and romantic inter-species relationships, while the opposite
extreme is sometimes violence based on xenophobic prejudices. Humans who
have been exposed to alien races since a young age will often base their
opinion of aliens as a whole off that experience, while humans who had
no such exposure will trend toward being xenophobic and isolationist.
Notably, humans who grew up in poverty are also more inclined toward
xenophobic tenancies, whereas humans who were better off will not have
their views significantly affected by their economic status.

Relations
---------

The [United Systems of Sol
Central](/wiki/United_Systems_of_Sol_Central "wikilink"), aka SolGov, acts as
most of humanity's representative. As of 2560, there are no ongoing wars
between SolGov and any known sapient species, although
Sol-[Moghes](/wiki/Moghes "wikilink") tensions continue to run high, and
[Vox](/wiki/Vox "wikilink") raiders remain a nuisance.

The [Skrell](/wiki/Skrell "wikilink") are humanity's oldest contact and
closest allies, with free migration between the two species' space and a
great deal of cultural interchange. However, some on both sides accuse
the other species of tampering with their own natural growth and
development, and many libertarian humans loathe the caste-based monarchy
of the Skrell.

Humanity is still licking their wounds after their war with the
[Unathi](/wiki/Unathi "wikilink"), and despite their victory, still regard
Moghes with a good deal of fear. Efforts on both sides of the border to
ease tensions have not prevented the occasional wave of xenophobic
violence.

The [Tajaran](/wiki/Tajaran "wikilink") were lifted into the FTL age by human
intervention, a fact neither is likely to forget. Humanity bears over
the Tajaran and freely exploit migrant labor, while they look upon their
uplifters with a mix of gratitude and wounded pride.

Like most races, humanity views the [Dionaea](/wiki/Dionaea "wikilink") as
curiosities and little else, given their disinterest in the ways of
other sapients.

The [Teshari](/wiki/Teshari "wikilink") are a rarity outside of Skrell space,
and a negligible presence on the astropolitical landscape. The average
human accepts the Skrell's paternalistic view of the Teshari as fact.

Despite the disastrous early stages of a war with the
[Sergal](/wiki/Sergal "wikilink") race, many efforts have been made to build
good relationships between Sol and [Vilous](/wiki/Vilous "wikilink"). Having
brought both Sergals and [Nevareans](/wiki/Nevarean "wikilink") into the FTL
age, the two races share a relationship with humanity not unlike that of
the Tajaran. This is largely thanks to [Operation
Dominion](/wiki/Operation_Dominion "wikilink"), a post-war reconstruction and
propaganda campaign on [Tal](/wiki/Tal "wikilink"), which began in response to
the [Vilous Incident](/wiki/Vilous_Incident "wikilink").

Individually, while humans may vary widely on how they feel of the other
known species, centuries of cultural xenophobia often prove difficult to
shake.
