The **Medical Doctor** as a role is a **vital** one. If you know what
you're doing - and you will eventually - you *will* save lives. Nearly
every death can be prevented, provided you reach the victim in time.
Since Medical Doctors are the only ones with the tools and the in
character experience to save them, Medical Doctors tend to make a lot of
friends. You should know what most chemical medicines are (although you
are not required to know how to make them), so look that up on the
[Guide to Chemistry](/wiki/Guide_to_Chemistry "wikilink"). It never hurts to
know what the other medical stuff does, but if you have a
[Chemist](/wiki/Chemist "wikilink") that can make them, they can also tell you
how to administer them.

**There is no disadvantage to pursuing knowledge regarding medical.
Learn, and keep learning.**

Overview
--------

Normally you start with a sterile jumpsuit and labcoat holding an
[advanced kit](/wiki/Medical_Items#Advanced_Medical_Kit "wikilink"). Medbay is
located on the top floor (Asteroid 3) west of the elevator, which is
where you will want to go. If you're in a reception area with white
floors and blue accents, you're in the right place (just don't get
confused with Surface Triage on *Surface* 3).

As a Medical Doctor, your job is to heal people, save them from the
brink of death, and [resleeve](/wiki/Guide_to_Resleeving "wikilink") those
that are dead. You can diagnose injuries with the help of a [health
analyzer](/wiki/Medical_Items#Health_Analyzer "wikilink"), which you helpfully
spawn with. Your PDA can work as an alternative, thought he standalone
is far superior. From a roleplay standpoint, you and the rest of medical
are *meant to be* the only ones who can understand the readout.

In terms of your equipment, the general rule is that chemical treatment
works at all health levels, whereas physical treatments have limits
where they become ineffective. Rolls of gauze and ointment are for minor
injuries and don't yield much in the way of treatment other than first
aid. [Advanced trauma and burn
kits](/wiki/Medical_Items#Advanced_Trauma_Kit "wikilink") are more effective
and should be used anyway, as there is an abundance. Beyond that, more
advanced treatment is needed.

Department Facilities
---------------------

Medbay has a few different yet important facilities such as the
Emergency Treatment Center (ETC), Sub-Acute/Recovery Ward, Exam Room,
Patient A, B, and C rooms, Operating Theatres, Chemistry, Psych Room,
Primary Storage, and Resleeving Lab. In Primary Storage and near the
Patient rooms are stairs leading to lower medbay, which includes
Secondary Storage, the Morgue, Break Room, EMT Bay, and Virology.

### ETC

![](ETC.png "fig:ETC.png") This is the Emergency Treatment Center, the
highlight and possibly the most important area of Medbay. It features
[two sleepers](/wiki/Medical_Items#Sleeper_.26_Sleeper_Console "wikilink") for
quick treatments and [a body
scanner](/wiki/Medical_Items#Body_Scanner_.26_Body_Scanner_Console "wikilink")
for in-depth diagnostics and analysis that a health analyzer wouldn't be
able to yield, as well as [two cryo
cells](/wiki/Medical_Items#Cryo_Cell_.26_Freezer "wikilink") for all-around
treatment. There is also a
[defib](/wiki/Medical_Items#Defibrillator "wikilink") charged and ready, two
rechargers for the defib batteries, [extra roller
beds](/wiki/Medical_Items#Roller_Bed "wikilink"), [an IV
drip](/wiki/Medical_Items#IV_drip "wikilink") for patients who need blood in
an emergency with blood bags in a locker, and a sink.

### Sub-Acute Ward

A large room with six beds and a
[NanoMed](/wiki/Medical_Items#NanoMed_Plus "wikilink"). Patients that are
recovering from treatment - such as surgery - are placed here until they
are fit for work again. It also features window tinting and a door
button so that patients may leave whenever they wish.

### Examination Room

Basically an over-glorified patient room. Includes a few items to
diagnose trivial ailments and a bed. Also has window tinting and a door
button so that patients may leave whenever they wish. <s>Mostly used to
lewd people than actually perform examinations *you filthy animals.*</s>

### Patient A-C

Small rooms with no access requirements on the doors. Good for isolating
patients when the Sub-Acute isn't private enough for their liking.
Features window tinting.

### Operating Theatre 1 & 2

These rooms are dedicated to performing osteopathy, and include the
tools needed to carry out such. These rooms are better known as OR1 and
OR2 respectively. OR1 has two sets of surgical instruments, allowing two
surgeons to operate on one patient at the same time. OR2 is smaller and
features only one set of tools, but is used more often. Both rooms have
an anesthetics closet, IV drip, blood bags, patient monitoring consoles,
and window tinting.

### Resleeving Lab

![](Resleeving_lab.png "fig:Resleeving_lab.png") If you've heard of
cloning, [resleeving](resleeving "wikilink") is just about the same but
with a few more steps involved. This room contains a resleeving console
to control the following equipment: a growing vat to grow a body from a
body record, a cryogenics tube to mend any physical defects of the
sleeve, and a resleeving unit to sleeve the patient's latest mind record
into the body. The room also contains a locker with spare clothing and
radios, window tinting, and a door button so that patients may leave.

### Primary Storage

A small room pretty much in the middle of medbay with a
[NanoMed](/wiki/Medical_Items#NanoMed_Plus "wikilink"), SmartFridge connected
to Chemistry, [NIFSoft disks](/wiki/Nanite_implant_framework "wikilink"), two
doctor equipment lockers, and [a few stasis
bags](/wiki/Medical_Items#Stasis_Bag "wikilink") among other equipment. Has
stairs leading down to Secondary Storage.

### Chemistry

![](Chemistry.png "fig:Chemistry.png") A lab that a
[Chemist](/wiki/Chemist "wikilink") normally works in connected to Primary
Storage with [three
dispensers](/wiki/Medical_Items#Chem_Dispenser "wikilink"), [three
ChemMasters](/wiki/Medical_Items#ChemMaster_3000 "wikilink"), three large
beakers, a [grinder](/wiki/Medical_Items#Reagent_Grinder "wikilink") with a
few sheets of phoron, a couple of lockers with chemistry equipment and
attire, and a SmartFridge for storing medicine synthesized by the
[Chemist](/wiki/Chemist "wikilink"). Features a button to close the window
shutters in case of potential break-ins.

### Psych Room

A somewhat large, comfy room for the
[Psychologist](/wiki/Psychologist "wikilink") to use to assist patients with
their mental fears and troubles. Features a chemical closet, bookshelves
and therapy dolls, couch and chair, and window tinting. **If the windows
are tinted, then it's probably best to not go inside.**

### Secondary Storage

Down here is where a bit more equipment is stored, such as a handful of
medical kits, a defib, three roller beds, medical belts, stethoscopes,
two doctor equipment lockers, and - probably the most important of all -
the cryogenics freezer controlling the cryo tubes above.

### Morgue

A dark and dusty room with [eleven morgue
trays](/wiki/Medical_Items#Morgue "wikilink"), body bags, and an autopsy table
with scanner.

### EMT Bay

![](EMT.png "fig:EMT.png") This compact room features the bare
necessities that [Paramedics](/wiki/Paramedic "wikilink") will equip to take
on the challenges of retrieving patients during an emergency. This
equipment includes two EMT lockers, [two (disassembled) EMT
voidsuits](/wiki/Medical_Items#Medical_Voidsuit "wikilink") with [a suit
cycler](/wiki/Guide_to_EVA#Suit_Cycler "wikilink"), [a Rescue
RIG](/wiki/Medical_Items#Rescue_Hardsuit "wikilink"), and [a compact
defib](/wiki/Medical_Items#Compact_Defibrillator "wikilink"). The room is
accessed through two windoors, which can both be clicked so that they
remain open for faster access.

### Virology

A large but seldom used facility for virologists. Features two basic
quarantine airlocks, two isolated patient rooms, a large quarantine
room, [an isolator](/wiki/Medical_Items#Pathogenic_Isolator "wikilink"), [a
disease analyzer](/wiki/Medical_Items#Disease_Analyzer "wikilink"), [two
incubators](/wiki/Medical_Items#Pathogenic_Incubator "wikilink"), two
centrifuges, and a [food dispenser for
viruses](/wiki/Medical_Items#Virus_Food_Dispenser "wikilink").

Damage and Diagnosis
--------------------

### <span style="color:red">Brute Damage</span>

Perhaps the most common and prevalent form of damage, brute is the red
number on the health analyzer. Anything that results in physical trauma
such as punching, cutting, stabbing, low pressure, or anything else that
causes bruising or cuts is summed up by brute damage. Bruising, under
most circumstances, won't cause bleeding, and small amounts of bruising
can be easily treated with an advanced trauma kit. Cuts, on the other
hand, may cause bleeding and must be treated immediately with either
gauze or kits.

Using trauma kits will instantly heal three brute damage and will
trigger the patient's mob to slowly heal on it's own. Higher levels of
brute (such as 50 and above) may require Bicaridine for more effective
and swift treatment.

#### Blood Loss

<small>See also: [A More Detailed Guide on Blood
Loss](/wiki/Guide_to_Medicine#Low_Blood_Count "wikilink")</small>

All crew have blood, and said blood carries oxygen throughout their body
to keep it alive. Loss of blood means less oxygenation, and puts the
patient's life at risk if not remedied quickly. Blood loss can be caused
by cuts, intense burns, loss of limbs, damaged lungs, destroyed liver,
or **internal bleeding**. Common symptoms of low blood levels are
dizziness, fainting, pale skin, blood dripping from the patient and onto
the floor, **oxygen damage**, and - perhaps the worst of all - brain
damage. Critical levels of blood loss will eventually build up enormous
amounts of toxins and will swiftly kill the patient.

Treating bleeding should be your first priority, which can usually be
accomplished by applying gauze or trauma kits to the area in question.
Internal bleeding, however, is different, and will require the body
scanner to locate where it is occurring and
[surgery](/wiki/Surgery "wikilink") to remedy it. Alternatively, Myelamine
(better known as Quick Clot) can be used to cure internal bleeding.

### <span style="color:orange">Burn Damage</span>

Burn damage is the yellow number on the health analyzer. Usually caused
by intense heat/cold (such as being in super heated atmosphere/fire or
space) or electrocution. Burns may cause intense pain and can put
someone into paincrit rather quickly, being electrocuted at high wattage
may dismember limbs, and intense burn sources can **boil out their
blood**. Burns also present a high risk for infection, which if left
untreated may become lethal.

Treatment for small burns can be accomplished by using ointment/burn
kits (to clean potential infections) alongside gauze/trauma kits (to
encourage healing). Higher levels of burn will require Kelotane or - if
a [Chemist](/wiki/Chemist "wikilink") is present - KeloDerm/Dermaline, which
both work much more efficiently than the basic medicine.

### <span style="color:green">Toxin Damage</span>

Toxin damage is the green number on the analyzer. Poisons, overdosing,
phoron exposure, radiation, critical blood levels, a damaged liver,
infections, and handling contaminated items all result in toxin damage.
Toxin damage may be hard to identify outside of using a health analyzer,
though common symptoms are aching, stinging, vomiting, and damage to the
liver, though other organs may be damaged depending on the poison in the
patient's blood.

Treatment should always start with removing the patient from the source
of the toxins.

-   **Poisons/Overdosing:** Activate dialysis in a sleeper.
-   **Phoron Exposure:** Request the patient to remove *all* clothing
    articles and place any contaminated clothing in a washing machine.
-   **Radiation:** Administer Hyronalin/Arithrazine and place them in a
    cryo tube if they have clone damage.
-   **Infection:** Administer Spaceacillin and monitor the stage of
    infection.
-   **Gangrene/Necrosis:** Amputate/extract the limb/organ in question.
    If the organ is vital to the patient's health, keep patient stable
    until robotics can fabricate a replacement organ.
-   **Damaged Liver:** Administer Dylovene/Carthatoline if the damage is
    below 15. If the damage is above 15, administer Peridaxon or conduct
    surgery to heal the organ.
-   **Critical Blood Levels:** Hook patient up to IV drip with O-
    attached immediately.

Once all of the sources of toxins are gone, administer Dylovene in
appropriate quantities. Dylovene does not overdose (it does, actually,
but the resulting toxins are cured by the Dylovene itself).

### <span style="color:blue">Suffocation Damage (Hypoxia)</span>

Suffocation damage (aka Hypoxia) is the cyan number on the analyzer.
Lack of breathable air, damaged lungs/heart, blood loss, and suffering
from critical health may all contribute to the lack of oxygenation.
Symptoms are gasping and loss of consciousness.

Treatment can be done by performing CPR on the patient, supplying
internals with doubled pressure output, or by administering
Inaprovaline, Dexalin, or Dexalin Plus.

### Other Conditions

Four primary damage types aside, there is also:

-   Organ Damage: Just plain damage that could easily threaten the life
    of the patient. Peridaxon is the go-to medicine to treat such
    damage, though some medicines like Imidazoline and Alkysine treat
    some specific organs faster. Otherwise, use surgery to cure the
    damage directly.
-   Brain Damage: This works the same as the above, but is much more
    important as too much damage to the brain will kill you instantly
    with no chance of resuscitation, requiring resleeving all together.
-   Clone Damage: Damage on the genetic level that can affect someone's
    overall health. Coming out of a stock growing tube will leave you
    with clone damage, as well as suffering from the effects of high
    doses of radiation. Treatment is as simple as placing the patient in
    a cryo tube of cryoxadone/clonexadone, or by administering Rezadone.
    Not to be confused with mutations.

### Medical States

There are three type of medical states. The first is 'shock', which is
the least dangerous of the three. If someone takes enough damage from
any damage type, they may go into shock. This causes stammering and slow
movement, and eventually collapsing and loss of consciousness. This can
be dealt with by simply treating the most prevalent damage, or
temporarily by administering a painkiller.

The second is known as 'soft critical'. When someone is below 0% health
(having taken more than 100 points of damage), they will suffer shock
until they are above 0% health.

The third is known as 'critical' and occurs at -50% health (more than
150 points of damage). At this point, the patient will go unconscious,
stop breathing, and take suffocation damage as a result. This can be
stopped with Inaprovaline or CPR. Immediate treatment is advised, though
a cryo tube may assist in keeping them stable.

### Surgery

<small>See also: [Guide to Surgery](/wiki/Surgery "wikilink")</small>

Surgery mostly encompasses mending broken bones and dealing with
internal bleeding or incredibly high amounts of organ damage. Generally
you should leave this to Surgeons unless there are none.

### Overdoses

Medicine treats injuries, but too much medicine can *cause* the injury.
Most medicines will overdose at 30 units, though a few (such as
Dermaline and Dexalin Plus) will overdose with only a full syringe
(15u). Overdosing will begin building large amounts of toxin damage in
the patient and, should it happen, will have to undergo immediate
dialysis treatment.

A good rule of thumb is that **if you're injecting more than one whole
syringe of one particular medicine, then the patient is probably already
dead with that amount of damage.**

Strict Policies
---------------

Medical staff are expected to be professional about their treatments and
confidentiality. Assistant Bubber Jones really wants to know about Cindy
Kate's obstetric history? Deny them, they don't have the right to access
that information outside of the patient's consent. Engineer doesn't want
to get treated for their dangerously high amounts of Radiation? You'll
have to let it go, he's denying treatment.

### [Medical Oath](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure#Medical_Oath "wikilink")

The oath that *all* medbay staff take, including you. To sum it up: Do
your job and give it your best, you're to be professional, you're to be
honest, you shall do no harm in the field of treatment, you will not be
biased, you will not refuse a patient treatment, you will refuse
treatments and policies that go against the intent of the oath, you will
assist the patient in making informed choices regarding their treatment,
and you will learn and keep learning.

### [Non-Disclosure Policy](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure#Non-Disclosure_Policy "wikilink")

Everyone has problems, and many problems and treatments don't need to be
made public to others, not even the [Colony
Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink") or [Central
Command](/wiki/Chain_of_Command#CentCom "wikilink") if they order you to.
Everything about a patient is to remain confidential, only to be shared
with the patient and the medbay staff involved. The only way this can be
overturned is if all patients involved consent to divulging their
medical information, or if the [Chief Medical
Officer](/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer "wikilink") orders it.

### [The Right to Refuse Treatment](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure#Right_to_Refuse_Treatment "wikilink")

Patients are granted the ability to refuse medical treatment as long as
they are fully capable of understanding and consenting to the refusal.
People under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol are unable to deny
treatment. Essentially a patient can tell you to stop treating them at
any time as long as they are fully aware of what they're ordering. This
may in fact spur drama and blame from friends of the most-likely
deceased crew member, but it is not your fault. Ignoring this right
would be to ignore SOP and could very well result in the termination of
your employment.

Modern Miracles
---------------

### Cryogenics

Cryogenic tubes will heal pretty much every surface damage **as long as
they're cold enough** and **if they have a cryo mix in them**
(Cryoxadone/Clonexadone). To setup, walk down to Secondary Storage and
locate the freezer on the west wall. Set the temperature anywhere
between 20K and 80K. Setting it too low will just keep the freezer
running the whole round and draining a ton of power. Setting it too high
may result in the patient's body not cooling in time for the cryo mix to
work. Once that's set, head back up and place the beakers of Cryoxadone
in the tubes unless there's a chemist, in which case you may want to
leave it to them to decide a mix for the tubes.

### Resleeving

Interesting tech from [KHI](/wiki/Kitsuhana_Heavy_Industries "wikilink")
presents a new take on cloning:
[Resleeving](/wiki/Guide_to_Resleeving "wikilink"), a method that involves
keeping the body record and mind record separate, potentially allowing
patients to transfer to a new body of their choice on a whim. Resleeving
is paired with backup implants which periodically backup someone's mind
state to a server versus someone's one time scan with conventional
cloning technology. On top of this, once a backup implant is unable to
backup a patient's mind state, the server will broadcast over the
medical frequency that the backup has failed and that the patient is
most likely dead.

To resleeve, do the following:

1.  Listen for the death alarm over the radio, or when someone requests
    that they be resleeved.
2.  Ensure the patient still has a mind record through the console. If
    not, there's nothing you can do unless the body is still intact.
    -   If the body is intact without a mindscan, use a SleeveMate on
        the body and scan their brain (not their whole mind).
3.  Begin growing the body. After some time, the body will be ejected
    from the tube with roughly only 20% health due to clone damage.
4.  Place the body in the cryogenics tube and turn it on. Retrieve a
    jumpsuit from the spare clothing locker.
5.  Eject the body once it has reached full health and place the
    jumpsuit on them.
6.  Place the body in the resleeving tube and sleeve their mind record
    into the body.
7.  Eject the body, buckle to a chair, and shake them awake.
8.  **Tell them the truth** unless their records say otherwise, avoid
    speculation, attend to any of their concerns.

Roleplay Tips
-------------

-   You're a doctor, you've spent many years getting to where you are
    now. You're more than likely a professional.
-   Professional does not mean arrogant or pretentious.
-   Doing the bare minimum to treat a patient just to shove them out the
    door so they can get back to work is a waste of roleplay
    opportunity. Speak with the patient, keep them informed.
-   You'll probably notice pretty much no one bothered to write their
    own medical records. Offer to update it for them in the exam room! A
    template can be found here[1](https://pastebin.com/CSgh68UT).
-   Medical staff are held to [very strict policies and
    procedures](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure#Non-Disclosure_Policy "wikilink"),
    **do not** neglect reading about them.
-   There is a nice array of alternate job titles for this role,
    allowing better specialization. Nurses take care of reception and
    assist doctors. Surgeons do surgery. Emergency Physicians handle
    critical injuries. Virologists do <s>nothing because there's no
    frikkin virus samples in virology</s>.
-   Remember that [you are *not* allowed to abandon medbay to scene
    during an
    emergency.](/wiki/Rules#You_are_expected_to_perform_the_job_you_signed_up_for "wikilink")
