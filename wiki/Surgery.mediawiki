=A Guide to Surgery In General=
All surgery requires the set of medical tools in the [[Operating Theatre]], along with an operating table. Ideally, only [[Medical Doctor|Surgeons]] and the [[Chief Medical Officer]] can perform advanced surgery. Remember to let each step complete fully, else you <s>risk harming yourself or your patient</s> like playing dangerously and want to ace that surgery.

===Field Surgery===
Generally this should only be put into play if you are unable to reach medbay or the operating rooms (e.g. singularity eats medbay) and surgery needs to be done immediately. Any table will work, though an operating table has the least chance of failures. Putting the patient in an aggressive grab and clicking the table will lay them on the table, from there you should probably instruct them to rest or else they'll just get back up. Roller beds, however, have a better chance of success than regular tables. The tools you use will also determine the success of each surgery, with a scalpel having the highest chance of success, a sharp knife being suitable, while some sharp object like a glass shard will spur issues.

===Surgical Tools===
Surgery tools aren't common and are pretty much only found in the operating rooms. The ghetto tools can be found just about everywhere.

===Infection===
Wear gloves and wash your hands before every surgery. Failure to do so will result in giving your patient an infection which, if left untreated, can be deadly. Apply ointment to the afflicted areas quickly if you fail to wash your hands before starting surgery. Make sure to clean your tools after every surgery as well with a spray bottle of either space cleaner or sterilizine '''If you use a syringe on a patient, dispose of it. Never re-use a syringe, else you risk giving the patient an infection. ''<u>You don’t want to spread infection.</u>''''' 

==Prepping for Surgery==
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:99%">
<i>Please ensure that your patients are properly diagnosed and scanned in a body scanner before starting the operation, and that all medications and personnel needed for the procedure have been prepared.</i>

<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
# Find a suitable [[File:OpTable.gif]] operating table.
# Make sure you're wearing [[File:LGloves.png]] latex gloves and a [[File:Sterilemask.png]] sterile mask.
# Ask the person to strip, or clickdrag them onto your body and click on all of their items to remove them.
# [[File:Grab.png]] Grab the person and click on the operating table to lay them down on it.
# Check the [[File:Crewmonitor.gif]] Operating Computer to ensure the patient is positioned properly; if the monitor does not show the patient's vitals, the surgery will not work.
# Clickdrag from the [[File:Entwenty.png]] anesthetic pump onto the patient to place the mask over their face and automatically enable their internals.
## Alternatively, pick up a [[File:BreathingMask.png]] medical mask and [[File:Anesthetics.png]] sleeping agent.
## Clickdrag their body onto yours to view their inventory. Place the medical mask on their mask slot and the tank of nitrous on their back.
## Clickdrag their body onto yours once again to refresh the window. A new option called ''Set Internals'' will appear towards to bottom. Clicking it will turn on the anesthetics after a short while.
# Examine the patient until it reports that they are unconscious, alternatively view the [[File:Crewmonitor.gif]] Operating Computer until their status reads 'Non-Responsive'.
# Make sure you're set on the [[File:Help.png]] Help intent.
# Use a '''sink''' to wash your hands. Unclean hands can result in an infected wound. This is treatable with ointment.

==Surgery List==
There are many different types of surgeries that can be performed. Sometimes it will be necessary to have the patient hooked up to an IV or someone on standby to inject medications during the procedure.

=Synthetic Patients=
==Roboticist Guide to robo-surgery.==
Many of the same steps as listed above should be practiced on synthetic crew. While they may not bleed or have the risk of infection. Proper protocol should be followed. Also remember that '''"Screwdrivers [[File:Screwdriver tool.png]] having a 30% chance to fail."''' It is best to operate with '''nano-paste [[File:Nanopaste.png]]''' when available. As screw driver fails can cause further damage.
