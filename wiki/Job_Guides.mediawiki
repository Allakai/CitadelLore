Your '''Job''' is what NanoTrasen has assigned you to do aboard [[Virgo Orbital Research Establishment]]. It defines what equipment you start with, your ID card access, and what you're actually supposed to be doing.

Some useful links:
* [[Character Creation]]
* [[Chain of Command]]
* [[Standard Operating Procedure]]
* [[Guides]]
* [[Tips]]
* [[Job Selection and Assignment]]
* [[Identifying Antagonists]]

You should also read up about [[Corporate Regulations]], so you know your rights, and [[Clone Memory Disorder]] if you happen to die and be cloned. Not doing so is considered very bad form for [[Roleplay]]. 

Due to NanoTrasen equal rights laws, you might encounter some interesting new [[Species]] working alongside you.
