===[[File:Srybox.png|64px]][[File:Syringes.png|64px]]Syringes===
A syringe is a container especially used for holding injectable liquids. They have two modes -- inject and draw. While in draw mode, a syringe takes liquids from other liquid containers such as bottles and beakers 5u at a time, or takes a 15u blood sample from [[crew|people]]. While in inject mode it will push its contents 5u at a time into a target, including people or other containers. Note that one single syringe '''cannot be used on multiple patients,''' and will infect the patient with terrible things if this is ignored. If a syringe has its cap removed, then it is no longer safe to use that syringe on another patient. Holds 15u, found in NanoMeds and syringe boxes.
