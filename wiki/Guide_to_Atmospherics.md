Atmospherics (or Atmosia) is the land of pipes and air, a peaceful place
often left to its automatic work. To the untrained eye, it might appear
to be entirely impenetrable and useless, just a mess of pipes that
should be left alone to do their own work while the [Atmospheric
Technicians](/wiki/Atmospheric_Technician "wikilink") goof off in the break
room. But this is far from the truth.

Atmosia
-------

### Content

Atmosia contains several notable things that every Atmospheric
Technician should know about:

-   **Monitoring Computers** that allow the Atmospheric Technicians to
    check the atmospheric, fire, and power condition of the entire
    station
-   **The Atmospheric Pipe System** that takes in waste air from the
    rest of the station, filters it, and gets it ready to be used again
-   **The Distribution Computers** that allow control of the composition
    of the atmosphere station-wide
-   **Reserve air tanks** that can be filled in case Atmospherics'
    reserve tanks are destroyed
-   **Fire-fighting equipment** that enables Atmospheric Technicians to
    survive easily for extended periods in difficult atmospheres
-   **[Portable air pumps](/wiki/Portable_air_pump "wikilink")** that can be
    used to repressurize or depressurize areas of the station
-   **[Portable air
    scrubbers](/wiki/Atmospherics_Items#Portable_Scrubber "wikilink")** that
    can be used to clear toxins from the air
-   **[Portable space
    heaters](/wiki/Atmospherics_Items#Space_Heater "wikilink")** that can be
    used to keep an area from freezing
-   **[Pipe dispensers](/wiki/Atmospherics_Items#Pipe_Dispenser "wikilink")**
    that allow repair of disposal and air distribution pipes
-   **[Fuel](/wiki/General_Items#Fuel_Tank "wikilink") and
    [water](/wiki/General_Items#Water_Tank "wikilink") tanks** for use when
    fighting fires or other hazards
-   **Freezer and Heater** that can heat or freeze the gas in the pipes

### The Pipes

Atmospherics is pretty simple, but the pipe layout makes it slightly
confusing for the untrained eye. It consists of four pipe "loops", which
are color-coded for easy checking:

-   The dark blue loop is the **distribution loop**. It sends air to all
    the vents on the station, and is fed by the cyan and orange loops
-   The cyan air mix loop, which contains **mixed air** to feed into the
    distribution loop
-   The red/green loop, which **retrieves (red) and filters (green)
    waste air** from the rest of the station
-   The yellow/orange loop, internal to Atmospherics, which is used for
    **custom air mixes**

If you are confused on how each of these things work, this may be a
helpful way to think of the pipes: every section of pipes is like a tank
that holds gas. The pumps will simply move gas from that "tank" to
another "tank", or another section of pipes. There is not a flow through
the pipes, just the pumps, filters, and other devices. Opening a valve
will link two tanks together to be one tank, and closing it would make
them go back to two separate tanks.

The arrows on the image indicate the direction of flow of various pipe
systems. The dark blue arrow indicates the distribution loop carrying
gas out to the rest of the station. The red arrow shows the waste
intake. The yellow arrow shows both the direction of mixed air flow and
points towards the portable air pumps that are outside Atmospherics.

The air breathed by humans on Baystation 12 is made out of oxygen and
nitrogen, and is mixed on the south end of Atmosia (Air Mixing). The
gasses are pumped through the cyan tubes from their respective canisters
(**N2**, **O2**) and are mixed in the air canister (**Air**). The
breathable gas is then pumped through the cyan loop to the north of
Atmosia, where it is then pumped into the blue loop and out to the
station.

The filtering loop basically runs the gasses through the filters along
the green piping and injects all gas not filtered into the mixing
canister.

The "canisters" of the station's Atmospherics network are actually rooms
filled with the appropriate gas. The output of these rooms are
controlled by their respective Supply Control Computers, a small valve
that allows the gas to be injected into the pipes, and a filter pump
that moves the gas through the pipes.

To create a custom mix of gas, turn on the output of the supply control
computers, open the manual valves, and turn the output of the pump to
what you wish it to be. The gas will travel through the orange pipes
into the mixing chamber. The air mix is pumped into the mixing chamber
via a pump north of the orange loop. The mix obtained can then be pumped
into the distribution and filtering loop. Remember to open the hand
valve south of dark blue t-shaped valves and turn on the pumps or your
custom mix will just be redistributed through the red loop.

### The Gases

-   **N2**: One of the components of the Air mix. N2 soaks up heat in
    the air, and lowers the temperature of a fire. By association, it
    can very quickly lower the temperature of a fiery rupture to the
    point where the flames self-extinguish.

<!-- -->

-   **O2**: You [probably](synthmorph "wikilink") breathe this. Running
    out of O2 will cause your slow death by suffocation damage. It is
    also required for a fire to even start, and hold, ending the fire
    when the O2 or phoron is depleted. Having less than 16 kPa of O2
    flowing into your lungs chokes you.

<!-- -->

-   **Air**: The gas mix that is distributed in the station. It is
    composed of 79% N2 and 21% O2.

<!-- -->

-   **CO2**: An invisible, heavy gas, CO2 is one of the first and
    fastest gases the scrubbers suck out of the air. It chokes people
    effectively and quickly, and if you can be bothered to set the
    alarms up, will result in a invisible room that kills those in it.
    Takes some setup and can be very, very annoying. The emote for this
    at low levels is (gasps alone? chokes and gasps?)

<!-- -->

-   **N2O**: A white-flecked gas. Makes you laugh at low doses and at
    higher ones puts you to sleep. Scrubbers don't deal with it too well
    and portable scrubbers just choke on it. If using this as a sleep
    gas mix do \*not\* forget the O2 at at least 16 kPa, or you will
    kill someone.

<!-- -->

-   **Phoron**: The one truly flammable gas on the station,
    [phoron](/wiki/Phoron "wikilink") is orange and highly toxic. Of note is
    the fact that in the presence of any oxygen at high pressures,
    phoron pumped into air can and will spontaneously ignite on turf at
    high pressures.

Setting Up Atmosia
------------------

<img src="AtmosGuide.png" title="fig:AtmosGuide.png" alt="AtmosGuide.png" width="300" />
Properly initialized, Atmospherics, or "Atmosia", can keep the station
aired-up through nearly any emergency. Improperly initialized, it's a
waste of space at best and an outright fire hazard at worst.

Here's how to do it the right way:

1.  Go to every
    <span style=color:green;font-weight:bold>green-circled</span> pump
    and filter. Make sure they're all on and set to max pressure, so gas
    will actually be moved.
2.  Go to the <span style=color:red;font-weight:bold>red-circled</span>
    pump in the top right corner of Atmospherics (the one feeding air
    into distribution from the cyan air mix loop) and set its output
    pressure to around 300 kPa (So that pipes around the station can be
    edited without too much trouble).
3.  Go to every
    <span style=color:goldenrod;font-weight:bold>yellow-circled
    valve</span> and make sure they're turned on. You can tell if it's
    on by looking at the small light on its side; if it's green, it's
    on.
4.  Go to every computer at the edge of the room and click "Search" so
    that the computer will register the gas inside of the tank. Use the
    O2 and N2 computers and set their vents to the maximum pressure.
5.  Go into the engineering hallway where the external ports are and
    make sure the portable air pumps are connected to the gas ports so
    that they'll fill.

Now that Atmosia is set up, there is a short list of things which fall
under your stead:

-   First and by far most important: make sure pipes don't get broken
    and if they do, fix them.
-   Go around swiping your ID on air alarms, setting phoron and N2O to
    filter automatically, and then re-swiping to lock it. You can ask
    the AI to do this as well, and probably should.
-   Least importantly, maintain the disposals system. You can generate
    pipes with the disposal pipe dispensers.

Air Alarms
----------

Air alarms are the central tool of an atmos tech outside setting
atmospherics up. To use an air alarm, simply swipe your ID across it.
Here's the different options:

**Panic Syphons:** They turn all vents off and set all scrubbers to
syphon.

**Vents:** you control vents through the air alarm. There are the
following settings:

-   External on, Internal off: will drain/add air from the tile the vent
    is on to make it the correct amount. All air being moved goes
    into/comes out of the pipe the vent is attached to. Set to 0 to
    drain air, or pressurise to specific levels.
-   Both on: completely useless. Don't bother.
-   External off, Internal on: Drains/adds air to the tile to get the
    pipe attached to the correct level. Setting a vent to internal and
    the desired pressure to 0 causes ALL gas which enters the pipe to be
    shunted out onto the tile.

**Scrubbers**: two settings, scrubbing and syphoning.

-   Scrubbers will slowly drain any gasses set to scrub in the air of
    the tile they are on, and transfer it to their pipe. Really, really
    slow with N2O.
-   Syphons will do the same, except indiscriminately and drain all
    gasses on their tile.

After you've set up Atmosia, you can go around and configure the various
air alarms on the station to filter out toxins, NO2, and CO2. They
default to filtering only CO2, but the other two are just as dangerous.
You can get the AI to help you with this, though, so it's not that
difficult.

Pipe Dispensers
---------------

There are a few different pipes and devices that you can get from the
dispensers, each with specific uses.

Pipe Dispenser:

-   **Regular pipes** - The station is infested with these thing.
-   **Insulated pipes** - Keeps the cold out if you're placing pipes out
    in space. (Regular pipes don't transfer outside heat at all from the
    environment, so these are pretty much regular pipes without the
    luxury of manifolds.)

**Devices**

-   Connector - Used to attach canisters, pumps or scrubbers to a pipe
    network. If you can't get a pipe network easily to the filter loop,
    an empty canister can be a good substitute.
-   Unary vent - See: Vent. Once placed down it will have to be turned
    on by activating it at an Air alarm terminal.
-   Gas pump - The basic pumps you'll find all over Atmospherics. This
    is how you will move most gasses. Maximum flow rate of 200 L/s
-   Pressure Regulator - Lets you limit how much of a gas flows into a
    pipe, either by limiting its flow rate in liters per second, or by
    maximum pressure. You can also set it to have no limit, and it will
    act as a one way valve.
-   Scrubber - Self explanatory, scrubs the nasty out of things, or acts
    like a vacuum. Like unary vents, needs to be turned on by an [air
    alarm terminal](/wiki/Electronics#Atmos_Alarm "wikilink") after being
    wrenched into place.
-   Meter - Wanna know how much gas is in a pipe? Wrench these onto the
    pipe and you can see its pressure and temperature. (Helpful hint: In
    a room with the default 101.3 kPa atmosphere pipes &lt; 303.9 kPa
    pressure can be unwrenched.)
-   Gas Filter - Filters out a selected gas, while pushing the filtered
    gas mix out of the output. These are used at each of the gas tanks
    to separate waste into each individual gas.
-   Gas Mixer - Like a filter, but mixes gasses instead of filters.
    There is one in Atmospherics that mixes nitrogen and oxygen to
    create the station's air mix.
-   Omni Gas Filter - Like a Gas Filter, but can filter up to two gases,
    customize the location of the input, output, and filter ports, and
    in general are just better than normal filters.

**Heat Exchange**

-   Pipes - H/E pipes transfer temperatures between the environment and
    gas within'. Besides looking spiffy, you can place some in space to
    cool gases, or create a burning length of death pipe.
-   Junction - Turn that regular pipe network into a H/E network, and
    back again! After all, you have to get that gas safely into space
    *somehow*!
-   Heat Exchanger - These strange and esoteric devices equalize the
    temperature between two pipe networks without actually mixing the
    gases. To use, place them facing each other. (So you're going to
    need at LEAST a 1 X 4 area to set this up.)

**Disposal Pipes** are made through the disposal pipe dispenser; use
them to fix or expand the disposals system on the Exodus.

Pipe Prospecting
----------------

Atmospherics isn't the only place with pipes, the entire pipe system is
there to explore.

-   Officially, Atmospherics has one other official room on the station,
    a small room in maintenance just north of the [Fitness
    Room](/wiki/Fitness_Room "wikilink") and just east of the [Detective's
    Office](/wiki/Detective's_Office "wikilink"). This room can isolate the
    Security wings distribution system with its own feed of gas,
    canister of air mix included within.

<!-- -->

-   The [Incinerator](/wiki/Incinerator "wikilink") provides a good off-site
    burn room.

<!-- -->

-   The [Construction Area](/wiki/Construction_Area "wikilink") is a oft
    disused little haven that's just asking for some pipes, it even
    comes with an Air alarm that controls nothing that you don't build
    yourself! This place provides a great blank canvas for any sort of
    atmospheric experimentation outside of Atmosia. However, it's a
    little far from any distribution pipes.

<!-- -->

-   The [Vacant Office](/wiki/Vacant_Office "wikilink") is also a prime
    location for Atmospherics, though there already is a vent system in
    place as well as plenty of annoying desks to dismantle, it can be a
    place to practice your pipe skills.

<!-- -->

-   By [Arrivals](/wiki/Arrivals "wikilink") and also the airlocks leading to
    the [Toxins Test Chamber](/wiki/Toxins_Test_Chamber "wikilink") in the
    maintenance tunnels are two large cans of emergency air mix that can
    be put into the system with the turn of a valve.

Finally, the entirety of the maintenance system itself is a giant
playground of pipes. Try using your T-ray to explore the vast pipe
systems.

Whatever you do, be responsible with your experiments. When in doubt,
adminhelp what you're going to do.

Notes about Pressure, Temperature, Volume and Heat Capacity
-----------------------------------------------------------

**PV=nRT** where R = 8: The following are linked by this equation.
Sadly, without either Volume or Moles, it's not useful in game and is
here for the theory.

**Pressure (P)**: Measured in kPa, kiloPascals, Pressure is lethal above
750 kPa's.

**Temperature(T)**: Measures in K, Kelvins, Temperature above x and
below y causes burn damage. Bomb making usually relies on a temperature
at or in excess of 90 kK. Floors and walls melt at a temperature of z.

**Moles(n)**: While not a variable that can be seen, Moles are the
amount of particles of a gas in the air. It is moles that cause odd
effects with a certain chemical. As it dumps so many moles to a turf, to
keep the pressure acceptable, the moles have to be very, very cold,
causing the infectious effect.

**Volume(V)**: Another unseen variable, Volume is the size of a turf, or
a canister, tank or piped tank. This helps dictate how much gas it can
hold. (Potential list of volume for a tile, pipe, airtanks, etanks,
canisters, ect?)

**Heat Capacity**: A gasmix has heat capacity, and it is calculated by
taking into account the quantity of all of the gases in the air and
their specific heat. Oxygen and Nitrogen have a specific heat of 20, CO2
has 30, and phoron has 200. The higher the specific heat, the more
energy required to heat up the mixture, meaning that with an air mix vs.
pure O2 mix, it takes much more energy to heat the air than the O2, and
the increase in energy required also decreases how much the fire
spreads. Simply slowing it down means that heat energy will be 'soaked
up' by the air instead of super-heating everything extremely quickly.

**Fire**: An effect usually caused by burning phoron, fire comes in two
different forms of hotspot. It causes massive burn damage, and a strong
fire will not be stopped by standard firesuits. Plumbing N2 into a room
might work, but heavy firefighting is not the point of this section.
Fire will ignite any form of combustibles in near tiles. Sufficiently
hot fires use less oxygen as they rise in temperature. This is due to
the fact that fires remove X phoron and X\*(1.4-Y, Y&lt; or = 1) oxygen.
X CO2 is produced.

Things to Do in Atmosia
-----------------------

### Fun Projects

-   The Atmospherics system is far from optimal, and I'm talking about
    just the pipe configuration! Break out that wrench and start
    experimenting! (Just make sure you know what's what.)
-   Extremely high temperature gases (Like those from a panic siphoned
    fire.) can really clog the waste loop. Can something be done to
    correct that?
-   No one uses the ports outside of the 'refilling' station, but that
    doesn't mean that functionality can't be added onto them!
-   Speaking of EVA suits, your engineering buddies can potentially help
    you with anything you might want to do in space, be it adding or
    modifying pipes.
-   The main cargo area inside Cargo has a laughably small number of
    vents, and how many times have those
    [geniuses](/wiki/Cargo_Technician "wikilink") sent the shuttle off while
    the doors are open?
-   The brig's distribution system is set up to be potentially
    independent of the rest of the stations distribution loop; maybe
    other places can be set up like this as well?
-   The mining station doesn't have air recycling. Very long rounds
    might make this a problem for any miners working there.

### Being a Traitorous Bastard

1.  Open valves connected to harmful gas you want to add to the station.
2.  Set pumps to the distribution loop to maximum pressure output (4500
    kPa)
3.  Set filters to not filter harmful gasses you want to add to the
    station
4.  Open valve from custom mix chamber
5.  Turn on pump leading to distribution loop
6.  Wait for vents to slowly kick out your deathgas mix as regular atmos
    drains out through the inevitable hull breaches. (Alternatively turn
    off pressure checks on atmos alarms vents)
7.  If you need to kill someone for your objective, and you want to be
    more proactive, the Fire Axe mounted in the wall is surprisingly
    effective. Just don't leave it lying around, because it's one of
    only two on the entire station.

To hurry this process up, you can set the air vents at local control
panels to maximum output pressure. Not doing so gives the AI and atmos
techs more time to notice what you've done and shut it off before it
takes effect.

Crafty atmos traitors will want to cut cameras, replace pumps with
pipes, and use tricky pipe configurations to avoid the AI interfering or
the detective trying to fix it.

**Warning:** If you plan on using any dangerous gas as a traitor,
adminhelp first. Say what you're planning and wait to get approval. Do
not act without an admin greenlight.

Tips and Trivia
---------------

-   Air Filters on currently burning mixes can siphon out heated but
    PURE O2 and Phoron. Do the O2 first then the phoron, as there is
    less O2 in a fire and thus it functions faster. This (and H/E) allow
    you to reach really obscene temperatures.
-   Air Filters and H/E allow you to expose gasses to the heat of fires
    (or their CO2 product) but keep/make them pure, allowing for hot N2O
    or similar.
-   Canister bombs are heated Phoron in a canister, with a O2 tank
    placed in the canister, and then open the valve between them. You
    will also need to run very, very fast.
-   You can hack an air alarm to use it as a
    non-[atmostech](/wiki/Atmospheric_Technician "wikilink").
-   Any time chemistry sets off an air-affecting grenade (Think
    Welderfuel/Ground Phoron), the particles spread themselves as part
    of an air mix. This can be annoying because, though the Air Alarms
    pick them up as "High Concentration of Unknown Particles Detected",
    they are impossible to suck down to Atmos. Spacing the entire
    affected air is, as far as I know, the only real "cure". There is a
    viable way to clean this, if you can safely cordon off the area.
    Detonating a welding fuel tank usually (always?) cuts a hole to
    space on the tile beneath it, and thus if you set your internals on
    and wear a fire suit, is a highly unsafe but effective way of
    draining the air. It is also one of the few ways to destroy pipes
    which are at a high pressure and thus can be a useful emergency
    cut-off if there is phoron irrevocably linked to distribution. It
    does KO you, do damage, and can make a space tile, which means
    without internals and a fire suit it can kill you. Caution is
    advised.
-   Pipes at higher than 300 kPa pressure cannot be unwrenched; keep
    this in mind when building or repairing any pipe systems.
-   If there is a large area that has a fire and is at sweltering
    pressure and temperatures, siphoning, filtering, and cooling will
    take a lot of time, power, and will clog the waste loop beyond
    imagination. Rather than using this method for large fires, It may
    be more advisable to vent the area to space, either by opening a
    hole in the floor, or opening a wall to space, which will empty the
    room of air and put out the fire. It would be *VERY* advised to have
    magboots on before you do something like this, as the change in
    pressure will send you flying.

### The Lesser-Known Hazards of Gas

-   N2O is invisible at low pressures. If you start giggling, put on
    your internals to avoid passing out.
-   Any gas can displace O2, and less than *16* (also useful for
    optimizing internals) kPa of oxygen starts the Oxyloss. CO2 can be
    removed with the scrubbers, but to get rid of N2 simply apply some
    way of removing gas from the air and adding O2. My personal favorite
    is 2 air pumps, 3 connectors and a Air Filter and a canister: 1 pump
    draws in, goes through the connection and filters N2 into the
    canister, and the rest to the other pump, which expels it. Can also
    be used for N2O which is only sluggishly scrubbed otherwise.
-   Pressures above 750 kPa do 10 brute damage per second plus 5 damage
    per second for every extra 375 kPa above that mark, rounded off.
    Space suits completely block it all, but there is no other defense.
