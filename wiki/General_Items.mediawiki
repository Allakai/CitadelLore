=== [[File:Id regular.png]] Identification Card ===
This things get you from A to B, as long as you have access to A, B and everything in between. Every worker of Space Station 13 gains an identification card. Your ID has your name, occupation, and a device that broadcasts your access to the station's autonomous systems, which is used both to identify the wielder and open up airlocks the worker have access to. For example, the [[Quartermaster]] has access to the Cargo Bay and Quartermaster's Office, while assistants, for example, do not. Keep this in mind when you see a person in medical uniform with the [[Head of Security]]'s ID card. 

If you hold an ID in your hand and use an airlock with it, this ID is used to determine if it opens instead of the ID in your ID slot. Also, IDs will grant you access to [[Computers]], but remember to remove it from the computer once you have logged out.

A person with the rights to access an [[Computers|Identification Computer]] can edit your ID to add or remove those rights, it should only be modified by the [[Captain]] or [[Head of Personnel]]. ''Special circumstances may change this.'' When your face is covered your ID is the only way of identifying you.

An ID is a tiny object and thus can be stored in a box. It can also be stored in your [[PDA]], and your PDA can even be stored in your [[Clothing_and_Internals#Jumpsuits|uniform]]'s ID slot.

<pre> This object is the only object in the game were the verb 'Read' comes into play (Verify).
When it's been read it displays the following: 
*"[NAMES]'s ID Card [TITLE]: The current assignment on the card is [TITLE]."
</pre>

==== Types ====
[[File:Id regular.png]] '''Standard ID''' - Standard identification cards issued to the general staff.

[[File:Id silver.png]] '''Command ID''' - Special silver identification cards issued to the [[Heads of Staff]]. By default, it allows access to the [[Bridge]] and has the ability to call/recall the [[Escape Shuttle]].

[[File:Id gold.png]] '''Captain's ID''' - The [[Captain]]'s gold-plated all-access ID card. A spare starts in the [[Captains Quarters]]. Desired by [[traitor|all]].

[[File:Id centcom.png]] '''Centcom ID''' - Identification cards issued only to Centcom officials, including [[Emergency Response Team]] officers.

For example a [[Pen]], a [[Internals#Specific_Items|breath mask]], an [[Internals#Specific_Items|emergency oxygen tank]] or an [[ID|ID Card]], would all be considered tiny and fit in a box. Something like a [[Internals#Specific_Items|gas mask]]), would not fit in a box.

On arriving the to the ship, each individual will have been provided with a box with an emergency oxygen tank and mask. Despite the generous effort and work we put into distributing these boxes, slacking employees tend do dispose of them early on, and those who don't, often use them to [[Traitoring|hide]] things.

Throughout the station, there are several varieties of boxes. The plain box is what most employees are used to, however NanoTrasen also labels boxes to hold different types of implants, spare [[ID]] cards, and even [[Guide to Food and Drink|Donk Pocket]]s!

Additionally, boxes can be unfolded into cardboard sheets, which can be used to make stuff.... that is made of cardboard! So now you can be the cardborg that you always were! Beep Boop!

The station bounced radio will function similarly to a standard earpiece radio if you put it in your pocket or in your hand; thus you can use the "say ;radio message" function as normal without turning on the microphone to broadcast. This is the only portable radio that will correctly function across in electrical storms, or when the [[Telecommunications]] satellite is damage.

Some radios are especially tuned to a [[traitor|clandestine network]] where [[Syndicate_Items|unmentionable contraband]] may be obtained. These also have an emergency detonation button that can do some [[Ghost|serious damage]].

}}


== Storage ==
===[[file:GrayCrate.png]]Crates===
Crates are a container for items. Especially large items, such as [[crew|corpses]], [[locker]]s, and [[roboticist#cyborgs|certain robots]] or equipment cannot fit inside. Just because an item comes packed in a crate when the [[Quartermaster]] receives it doesn't mean it will go back inside once the crate is opened, either!

====Give Onto the QM his Dues====
Crates are worth 5 supply points to a [[Quartermaster]], which can be used to get more supplies for the station's whole benefit.

====Of Locks and Access====
Just like the rest of the station, even crates have variable levels of access. The [[Quartermaster]] can't unlock anything that is locked by default, for various reasons. The primary one being it would be pointless to make since all crates go through the Quartermasters anyway. Security crates can be opened by security personnel and those with higher access, and et cetera. An [[Syndicate_Items#Electromagnetic Card|emag]] can get into locked crates, however.

===[[file:Closet.png]]Closets===
Also knows as Wardrobes or Lockers, Closets are among the most common and arguably the most useful of containers on the station. Nearly anything can fit inside, barring other closets, [[crates]], and certain especially large objects like [[racks]] and [[Quartermaster|Mulebots]]. Coffins in the [[Chapel]] also count as lockers.

====Of Locks and Access====
Besides being [[welding Tool|welded]] shut, some closets can be locked with the appropriate ID. Several levels of access exist, such as security, captain, and private-level access. These can be opened with the proper level [[identification card]], [[Syndicate_Items#Electromagnetic Card|emag]] item, or a few good laser blasts.

If you yourself are inside a locker you can see your surroundings. Normally you can move in any direction to exit the locker, but if the locker is locked or welded you will be unable to exit, and you cannot unweld or unlock your cell from inside. At that point if you try to move around you will instead throw yourself against the sides of the locker, making a'''BANG BANG''' sound that can be heard
