* If you're new to Space Station 13 in general, read the [[The Basics|Tutorial]] and [[General Help]] guides.

* If you're new to roleplay in general, read the [[A Crash Course In Roleplaying|Crash Course In Roleplaying]] and [[Character Creation]] pages.

* When you play as a job you haven't played before, always look over the wiki page for that job. Read the overview box at the top, and have a glance over all the linked guides.
