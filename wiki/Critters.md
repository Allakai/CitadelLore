What you need to know about critters
====================================

Critters are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence, not to be

limited reaction to the physics systems that human controlled mobs have
to deal with. This makes them unpredictable and frustrating as both
allies and opponents.

Critters are divided into four categories:
