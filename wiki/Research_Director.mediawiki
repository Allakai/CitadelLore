The [[Research Director]] in charge of what is (theoretically) [[Backstory|the reason the station is around]]. You job is to direct research into new things. And you have a group of [[Scientist]]s to help you do that.

== Overview ==
Unlike most Heads of Staff, your job isn't so much to keep [[Job_Guides#Medical_and_Science|your staff]] working as it is to ''keep'' them from doing so. Or, at least, to keep them from doing so ''badly''.

Technically speaking, your job is the least vital out of any of the Heads of Staff. The Science division isn't vital to the continued operations of the [[Virgo Orbital Research Establishment]], even if it is why it's there in the first place. The station won't fall apart if the slimes die, alien artefacts never get studied, and bombs never get made. It ''will'', however, fall apart if the slimes ''escape'', if dangerous alien artefacts aren't well-monitored, or if a poorly-made bomb destroys the Escape arm.

Your job, then is to keep them from accidentally killing themselves. [[Guide_to_Toxins|Toxins Mixing]] and [[Xenobiology|Xenobiology]] in particular are highly-dangerous areas, and should be monitored at all times. 

You're also the foremost expert on strange phenomena on the station. When [[Xenomorph|something strange]] shows up, it's your job to figure out what it is and how best to deal with it. The other Heads of Staff will rely on you to figure out exactly what it is and what to do about it. 

So, in short, keep your staff from screwing everything up royally and keep the other Heads informed about anything weird going on.

You arrive on the station inside your office next to toxins. You have the front seat. So sit back and enjoy the view. Remember that you have two of the most important things on the station, Robotics control and the AI integrity restorer.

== Directing Research 101 ==
As the Research Director, your job is obviously to direct research. You have access to anything scientific.

=== There's No I In Team ===
Your official responsibility is to ensure that nobody does anything they shouldn't. This means making sure the [[Geneticist]]s don’t run rampant with powers, that [[Roboticist]]s don’t cyborg people without good reason, and that Toxins does not destroy the station.

Try to stop Toxins from igniting. Teach your scientists the proper way to handle [[phoron]]. 

=== Computer Maintenance And You ===
In the event of AI damage on an Intelicard, there is a computer in your office which can be used to repair its systems. This is a long process, but it is still usually better than having no AI at all. In addition, it is possible to build a new AI from the circuit also found in your office. Using plasteel and glass, it is constructed just like any other computer up until the human brain is inserted. Keep the existence of the human component hush-hush! It's a [[Backstory#Nanotrasen|trade secret]]! Please be aware that a freshly constructed [[AI]] comes with the default NanoTrasen laws.

=== AI Overpopulation: The Core Circuit And You ===
Whether to reduce the load on primary AI or just to increase information chaos, with this nifty AI Core circuit board found in your office you can make a second, working AI. You need the following components first:
a screwdriver,
a wrench,
4 sheets of plasteel,
2 sheets of reinforced glass,
the circuit board,
and, of course, a brain in an MMI.

Make AI Core frame with plasteel, wrench it in a preferably secure place near an [[Intercom|intercom]] (or a radio), add circuit, screwdriver, wires, MMI, glass, screwdrive again. Voila! Now there's two working AIs on station!

=== Assistant with Science ===
You can be of great help as an assistant with large amounts of access. Collecting flashes and power cells for robotics and other items for research.

=== Upgrading the station===
NT has granted your colleagues a station that has plenty of room for improvement. Plenty of machines around the station can be upgraded to improve efficiency, and you're encouraged to let your coworkers feel what an efficient science really means: Better work conditions. Use the [[File:RPED.png]] Rapid Part Exchanger device, produced by the [[Protolathe]] to rapidly replace obsolete parts with newers parts; or deconstruct and reconstruct the machine from the getgo.
Use the [[Guide to Advanced Construction]] to check what parts each machine contains, to know what stock parts to replace. The RPED is also able to scan the stock parts present in the machine. Below is the list of currently upgradeable machines:
*Biogenerator. Upgrades improve recycling and lowers costs.
*Borg Charger. Upgrades speed charging and enables repairs.
*Protolathe. Upgrades cut production costs; up to half.
*Circuit Imprinter. Upgrades cut productions costs; up to half.
*Autolathe. Upgrades lower material loss in production, down to 0%.
*Destructive Analyzer. Upgrades increase minimum reliability that can be analyzed.
*Cloning Pod. Upgrades increase clone health; with the highest level removing the need for cryo.
*PACMANS. Upgrades decrease heat emitted and power produced per sheet.
*Gas heater/coolers. Upgrades increase efficiency and cooling range.

=== Lamar ===
Inside the display case in your office is a surgically modified [[xenos|facehugger]]. It can no longer kill and implant its embryos inside a host body, but it still feels the need to leap on anyone in reach. It's usually best kept in its case. Some [[Succubus|crew members]] may want to break into your office for Lamarr. They're weird.

== Links to Other Departments ==
As the research director, you are the link between the captain, the heads of staff, and your researchers. R&D supplies technology to the other departments and receives supplies from the miners and quartermaster. When something strange happens--someone [[changeling|turns into a monkey]], [[wizard|teleports without a device]], or has [[traitor|illegal technology]]--it's your job to try to explain what just happened. Good luck.

==Predding==
While you're less threatening than the [[head of Security|apex predator]], you do have a lot of cool toys to play with. You can easily get stun gloves ('Roleplay is not optional'), make stun guns and you have access to a [[telescience|personal lunch fetcher]].
