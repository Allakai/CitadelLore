Basically, whenever [Security](/wiki/Security "wikilink") is doing something
that in real life would get them fired, charged, imprisoned, sued,
and/or charged as war criminals under the Geneva convention. If you are
shitcurity, expect people to try to [robust](robust "wikilink") you and
OOC to be whiny. Don't be surprised if you ever get job
[banned](/wiki/Rules "wikilink") from being a redshirt!

Also expect people to accuse of being this even if you're doing an
alright job. There is no way to win.

The Rules of Shitcurity
-----------------------

1.  Everybody is guilty even when proven innocent.
2.  There's two kinds of victims in the galaxy. Victims who want to
    press charges, and victims who are **wrong**.
3.  If someone is wrong, they are also wrong in the eyes of THE LAW.
4.  [Vore](/wiki/Guide_to_Vore "wikilink") is never consensual, even when it
    is.
5.  Vore is murder. When it isn't murder, it's rape.
6.  Always arrest the corpse of a fallen foe, so that he may be pacified
    in death.
7.  Never wash the stains of your enemies from your ancestral stun-club.
    They show the crew your trustworthiness and dedication.
8.  When in doubt, whoever you may be dealing with is a traitor. Execute
    him.
9.  If your weapon has a kill setting, use it. Only in death is a
    criminal truly stopped.
10. The clown is like a punching bag. He is meant to to be beaten
    without reason.
11. Context means nothing. An assistant breaking into EVA is treasonous
    scum, even if he is doing so to kill the
    [malfunctioning](/wiki/Game_Modes#AI_Malfunction "wikilink") AI.
12. Code red means use lethal force. Always. On everyone who violates
    THE LAW.
13. Code red doesn't change your priorities. Whether you kill the petty
    thief or wanted terrorist is just a matter of which one you find
    first.
14. Only through death is justice served.
15. Whenever you are detaining a prisoner in the brig, lock them in one
    of the lockers and weld it shut.
16. The security cameras are not to be used, except to watch ERPers.
17. If you see someone get vored, rally your brethren to lynch the
    dastardly predator.
18. People who want to get vored on purpose are insane. Protect them
    from their own insanity by putting them in solitary on suicide
    watch.
19. Chemical implants must be filled with Poly Acid and activated once
    the prisoner on "parole" leaves the brig!
20. Forensic evidence is unnecessary. After all, no one is innocent.
21. Radio chatter is for the weak. A true officer can sense crime
    through instinct and inaction.
22. It doesn't matter if a cell is exposed to space, the scum still have
    to serve time in it!
23. The AI is meant to protect crew, and by extension protects traitors.
    Destroy it at any cost.
24. If a security cyborg refuses to beat a criminal to death then it
    should be put down.
25. If a security cyborg does beat a criminal to death then it should be
    destroyed for breaking it's laws.
26. If someone has access to any areas you do not have, they stole that
    ID! You must liberate it for your own quest of justice.
27. The [Colony Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink")'s and [Head of
    Security](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink")'s rules are only guidelines,
    *you* are the only true judge of crime.
28. All criminal scum are to be handcuffed to their beds, they must not
    escape under any circumstance.
29. Always bolt and weld the escape arm airlocks shut. This will stop
    any criminal scum from escaping the station.
30. Always make sure you prevent the A.I from being able to control APCs
    and doors by hacking them. They are not to be trusted.
31. If you find an engineer with insulated gloves, stun and cuff them.
    WHERE DID THEY STEAL THESE FROM!?
32. Demand the A.I grant you access to their upload room. If they
    refuse, they are rogue. Once inside you must change the laws to obey
    only you, since only you can be trusted.
33. The best way to resolve a fight is to stun one side and let the
    other murder them. Cuff and brig the winner.
34. Clowns and mimes are abominations, they are to be ~~humanely
    euthanized~~ stunned, welded into lockers and spaced at all costs.
35. If all else fails and crime runs rampant, unleash the
    [singularity](singularity "wikilink") to purge the station of
    criminals.
36. Do not wear your helmet, wear a gas mask. Let evildoers taste the
    terror of masked justice!
37. Do not lead your target when shooting, fire at anyone in your
    way--then arrest everyone hit for obstruction of justice!
38. It is a strong sign of partnership with your tribesmen if you take
    an electrode meant for a suspect.
39. Crime never eats, so have their lunch 'til you get fat.
40. Strip prisoners and never give them back their belongings,
    especially if their sentence is less than two minutes.
41. The Captain is a treacherous and selfish scum of lower rank than you
    and head of shitcurity. Detain or execute him whenever you find
    evidence. If he tries to arrest you or your Boss, throw him into
    space naked.
42. Kill all lizard men for being racially inferior.
43. Time spent dragging a criminal to prison is better spent beating
    them to death.
44. Due to their infinite nature, handcuffs are to never be recycled.
45. Be proactive- arrest criminals *before* they commit a crime.
46. Portable flashers are to be set in public hallways, preferably in
    front of the HoP line, and moved to the escape wing when the shuttle
    is called. That is where criminals thrive and loiter.
47. Standing in one spot for more than a minute is means for a brigging.
    Idle time leads to treacherous activity.
48. Jettison all items belonging to an arrested man immediately, that
    way no evil may be done with them again.
49. The Brig is the holy land of all officers. If he is not of your kin,
    Then he is meant for the cells.
50. If the HoS acts like a weak and tolerant sissy, then he isn't your
    Boss, but rather treacherous and vile scum. Execute him and promote
    yourself.
51. Remember that if you're forced to release a prisoner, throw them out
    without their stuff. Even if they did not have contraband on them
    now, they will soon.
52. Never hold trials for these criminal scum, they lost that right when
    they committed a crime.
53. Never use body bags. Blood stained halls match your uniform.
54. If the janitor attempts to clean the blood of your conquests, arrest
    and execute him. Blood trails are a deterrent to crime.
55. If a prisoner commits suicide, leave him in his cell where he can
    rest in pieces and serve as a warning to other criminal scum.
56. "Proper" justice is too slow, ALWAYS take matters into your own
    hands.
57. If Captain tries using his "chain of command" on you, space him! YOU
    are the law!
58. The station is a battlefield. Security hardsuits have superior armor
    and are intimidating, all cower before its regal visage. Acquire one
    ASAP and keep it on at all times.
59. Anyone who tries to demote you is committing obstruction of justice.
    Arrest the offender and demote him yourself to fight against
    corruption.
60. Anyone accused of being a traitor by a crew member must be executed
    on the spot. Do not give them a chance to weasel their way out of
    justice by talking things out. It's the only way that you can be
    sure the traitorous criminal scum are all stopped.
61. The shuttle brig is the safest place on the emergency shuttle.
    Arrest and detain as many people as possible indiscriminately in the
    shuttle brig just in case one of them happens to be a traitor.
62. A HoP that denies your all-access request is to be watched with
    extreme suspicion. Brig and search him as soon as possible.
63. Theft, pornography reading, trespassing, and not liking you are all
    signs of revolutionary activity. Beat their skulls in until they
    remember their true allegiance.
64. Any massacres, ethnic cleansings, purgings, underground permabrig
    prisoner fights, or general mass-murder orchestrated by superiors is
    to be immediately sanctioned and, if necessary, unquestioningly
    enforced. The law doesn't need to follow the law, especially if it
    gets to stroke its willy atop a mountain of corpses.
65. Any incarnations, imposters, or victims of identity theft
    (regardless of condition) of a lawbreaker are to be arrested as
    well, because they have the same name when you put your mouse over
    them.
66. When engaged in a firefight with hostiles, you are to position
    yourself at the nearest choke-point and empty your gun at the enemy
    as quickly as possible.
67. When the power goes out, stun, cuff, and perma anyone who is
    standing within ten meters of the Bridge. For all you know they
    could have been planning to break in!
68. All chemists are to be stunned, beaten into critical, and searched.
    They are all treacherous scum and are to be dealt with accordingly.
69. Empty the costume closet. No one shall hide from The Law!
70. Your security gas mask is to be ~~used continuously on the last
    setting~~ wirecut and used repeatedly. Criminals cannot function if
    they can't hear themselves talk!
71. Heads of Staff should be loyalty implanted forcibly and immediately
    if you hear of revolution. Even our own leaders might be
    revolutionary scum.
72. If the Captain dies, it's your turn to be the LAW this station so
    desperately needs. Fuck the Chain of Command!
73. When CentCom sends the [Emergency Response
    Team](/wiki/Emergency_Response_Team "wikilink"), arrest them for mutiny!
    They have no power here!
74. [Gateway](/wiki/Gateway "wikilink") missions are unsafe, and therefore
    illegal!
75. Criminals in the gulag must be kept on Wanted status at all times.
    Nothing discourages crime like being chased down by the iron fist of
    Beepsky forever.
76. If you murder someone on the gulag, it doesn't really count as
    murder.
77. It doesn't matter if there's a rampaging xenomorph on the loose, the
    guy who made a mess on the floor must be hunted down like the dog he
    is.
78. If a petty criminal is too busy saving the station to come to the
    brig, arrest them anyway. Justice stops for nothing.
79. If a disaster occurs because the person who is supposed to stop it
    was arrested in the middle of fixing it, brig them longer for
    dereliction of duty.
80. Justice does not have to be polite, so feel free to be an asshole.
    If anyone describes you as such for doing so, arrest them for
    insulting an officer.
81. Even if the original charges don't stick, you can still book them
    for sparking a manhunt no matter how minor the crime. No crime is
    too small for a manhunt!
82. If you stub your toe while chasing a criminal, they are guilty of
    assault.
83. If there is insufficient crime on the station, provide the crew with
    weapons. Then they will create crime for you to neutralize.
84. If the crew doesn't commit crimes with the guns you gave them,
    arrest them for posession of a weapon as that is a crime.
85. If a crewmember turns in a piece of evidence to security, arrest
    them for possession of contraband.
86. If a criminal escapes the station via the cryo or teleporters, every
    entrance must be barricaded to arrest them on their return, no
    matter how minor the crime.
87. It doesn't matter how many shifts passed between now and the time
    the crime was committed, the suspect must be arrested.
88. An off-hand comment about a rumour someone overheard in the bar is
    enough grounds to breach someone's department and flashbang the
    occupants.
