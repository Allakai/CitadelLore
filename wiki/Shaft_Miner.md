Welcome, **Shaft Miner**, to the wonderful caverns of this [NanoTrasen
Claimed Asteroid](/wiki/Mining_Station "wikilink").

### Your Boss

Your superiors are the Head of Personnel, and then the Quartermaster.
Generally they won't butt into any of your affairs other than talking
over the cargo channel and (if they know what they're doing) attempting
to coordinate your efforts for the good of the station.

### Chatting it Up

You can talk with all of your mining buddies, as well as the other cargo
technicians and the all-important Quartermaster, over the Supply channel
using **:u** or :h.

The Objective
-------------

You're here to mine, so get digging! Put on your mining hard-suit (make
sure to put a large oxygen tank in your suit storage), check your
[internals](internals "wikilink"), and cycle yourself out the airlock.
Then grab your drill in one hand, click on an ore tile, and pick up the
ore with your mining satchel. You can then empty the satchel into an Ore
Box, so it's probably best to drag one around with you.

If you prefer heavy machinery, you can use a [mining
drill](/wiki/Guide_to_Mining#Drill_101 "wikilink") to dig into the asteroid
for you. This is the only way to get hydrogen.

Once you're full to bursting with ores, drag your crate to the conveyor
belt outside of the airlock. From there, you can use the machines and
computers to [smelt raw ore to its finished
state](/wiki/Guide_to_Mining#Furnace_101 "wikilink") and stack them up to
50-count piles. From there, it's off to wherever those resources need to
be, but hopefully you have a [Cargo
Technician](/wiki/Cargo_Technician "wikilink") for that. Back to the mines!

Details on how do to your job can be found in the [Guide to
Mining](/wiki/Guide_to_Mining "wikilink").

### Who Needs What

-   [Scientists](/wiki/Scientist "wikilink") want a little silver, gold,
    phoron, uranium, diamond, and solid hydrogen. Refine a little of
    each for research (5-10 blocks each should do it; 2-5 for the
    diamond and hydrogen). In exchange, they may give you more advanced
    mining tools (like a sonic jackhammer), for even faster digging.
-   [Roboticists](/wiki/Roboticist "wikilink") need metal, plasteel, diamond,
    uranium, silver and gold for building mech parts. Give them enough
    and you might get a big, fancy machine for your troubles! The Ripley
    is the best mech for mining.
-   Everybody could always use more metal and glass, but especially
    [Station Engineers](/wiki/Station_Engineer "wikilink").

Traitoring
----------

A traitorous miner has a lot of advantages. You have a space suit for
free right away and your mining tools are pretty good weapons. As long
as you have some mineral wealth on you, no one will suspect your
presence around the station, even in highly restricted areas like
robotics or toxins. In addition, the mining station is isolated, hard to
get to, and as expansive as you're willing to dig out. Plenty of room
for somebody to get lost in... *Forever!*
