The Colony Director is in charge of the station and everyone on it. They
make sure the crew is [working and
productive](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure "wikilink") and any [potential
threats](/wiki/Game_Modes "wikilink") are seen to. They are expected to be
able to command their [Heads of Staff](/wiki/Heads_of_Staff "wikilink")
effectively, and have ultimate authority on the station.

Being a Colony Director
-----------------------

The Colony Director is the top of the [power
chain](/wiki/Chain_of_Command "wikilink"). They command the Heads of Staff and
have the final say in station decisions. The hold an all access ID, a
large amount of unique equipment, and a luxurious cabin. The only one
with potentially more power is the [AI](/wiki/AI "wikilink"). This is a very
important role and should only be played by experienced players.

### Commanding Command

The Colony Director's main job is to lead and direct the station. The
Colony Director therefore has direct authority over the [Heads of
Staff](/wiki/Heads_of_Staff "wikilink"), changing the alert level, going to
[red alert](red_alert "wikilink"), contacting CentCom, calling the
evacuation shuttle, and coordinating station-wide emergency evacuation
and defense.

In the absence or lack of a head for a specific department, effort
should be made by you, or the [Head of
Personnel](/wiki/Head_of_Personnel "wikilink") to appoint one to each
department. You should always have a fully functioning command staff.

It is the Colony Director's job to make sure that all the Heads of Staff
are communicating and leading their departments properly, or making sure
the [Head of Personnel](/wiki/Head_of_Personnel "wikilink") is doing it for
him. They should not involve themselves directly in departmental matters
unless asked by the Head of Staff responsible, however the Colony
Director may step in if they feel that the matter is being handled
poorly.

For example, the Colony Director should not have to tell the [Chief
Engineer](/wiki/Chief_Engineer "wikilink") to start the
[engine](engine "wikilink"), a competent chief should be able to do this
themselves. If they can't, it falls to the Colony Director to make the
decision as to whether to demote the current head, promote someone to a
head, or consult with that department as to the best course of action.
The Colony Director's job isn't to do others' work for them, but make
sure that everything is being done correctly.

### Controlling the Crew

As Colony Director, you are in charge. There really is no way to tell
you exactly how to run things, many people have different leadership
styles. However, as Colony Director, there are some things you should be
aware of:

1.  **Only involve yourself when there is nobody else available to do
    the job.** If you get involved in every security matter when there's
    already a Head of Security, it is suggested you get a job change. If
    there isn't a head for a specific department, get your Head of
    Personnel to assign a new one. The only exception to this rule is
    when your Head of Personnel is "absent" as you are the only other
    Head who can assign people.
2.  **Delegate whenever you can.** If someone says 'Admin, there's a
    phoron leak!' then you order your Chief Engineer to go fix it. Do
    NOT attempt to fix it yourself. You will put yourself unnecessarily
    at risk.
3.  **Follow the [Chain of Command](/wiki/Chain_of_Command "wikilink").** You
    command the Heads. The Heads command their departments. Try not to
    skip them in the decision making process. They are the ones who
    *should* know their own departments best.
4.  **Keep calm and carry on.** As Colony Director, every shift should
    be a normal and productive working day. However, be prepared to deal
    with any or all of the following: Incompetent or absent Heads,
    [subversive elements](/wiki/Game_Mode "wikilink"), angry crew members
    banging down the bridge door trying to get in, corrupted AI's on a
    war path, killer meteor strikes, plagues, faulty electrical gear and
    the occasional aftermath of an armageddon against the ship, thanks
    to a range of the above. And it's your job to manage it all. Good
    luck.

### Alerts and SOP

You have control of the station's alert level. See [Standard Operating
Procedure](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure "wikilink") for more details.

### Equipment

There are many items in your cabin, but not all of them should be used
all the time. Colony Directors are not supposed to involve themselves in
station matters, such as security, and you should not expect things to
go wrong, so wearing your special armour and carrying a lethal energy on
[green alert](green_alert "wikilink") is not expected or encouraged. You
are allowed to carry a weapon for self-defence, though it should not be
lethal. The 'chain of command' item is a novelty, and should really not
leave your office. The telescopic baton relies on brute damage to topple
the target, and does not stun in any way, so use it sparingly.

Your armour and helmet function as a space suit, but this does not mean
you should be wearing it all the time. The antique laser gun in the
glass case is an antique and should be treated as such, it shouldn't
leave its case, and is highly valuable.

The spare Colony Director's ID, handheld teleporter, and nuclear
authentication disk should be placed somewhere secure, for example the
secure safe on your wall, or a secure briefcase.

### Authority

The Colony Director has the final say on almost every matter on the
station. If the Colony Director tells someone to do something they
better do it, or have an exceptionally good reason to not do so. Colony
Directors should follow [Corporate
Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") and
[Security](/wiki/Security "wikilink") has the power to arrest the Colony
Director if they do not. The only time Corporate Regulations may be
overridden is if there is an imminent and overwhelming threat to the
station.

Situations where the Colony Director's orders are overridden are rare,
but may include orders that would cause unnecessary and large amounts of
damage to people or property, or are simply outrageously stupid. For
example, ordering the [Chief Engineer](/wiki/Chief_Engineer "wikilink") to
vent the bar of atmosphere as people are getting slightly tipsy. This is
not the norm however, and generally people should follow whatever the
Colony Director says.

### Dangers

NanoTrasen vessels are often under threat from various [criminal
organizations](/wiki/Game_Mode "wikilink") and natural space disasters. As
Colony Director , is it your job to manage these threats and make sure
that they do not interfere with normal activity aboard the station.

Most of the time, your on-board [Security](/wiki/Security "wikilink"),
[Medical](/wiki/Medical "wikilink"), and [Engineering](Engineering "wikilink")
forces should be sufficient to deal with the threat. Therefore, you are
not expected to have to deal with such matters by yourself, save for
when you have not been supplied with them, or you feel they are
incompetent.

Links to Other Departments
--------------------------

As a Colony Director, you have direct authority only over the other
heads of staff. This means that, if your Colony Director is the snooty
type, they can get away with never having to talk to the miners, the
cook, or the toxins researcher. On the other hand, there's nothing wrong
with playing a Colony Director who'll happily shoot the breeze with the
janitor. That's up to you and your character.

When it comes to other departments, your primary job is to coordinate
everyone's actions. Your Colony Director's headset lets you talk to all
heads of staff and hear any department's radio channel. If a department
has a head of staff, your primary interactions will be with them,
because they (should) know how to run their department. Without a head
of staff, you may have to step in. With or without a Head to work with,
make sure each department has the information and supplies it needs to
work well.

Predding
--------

You're the Colony Director, so you have a lot of freedom. While you
legally aren't allowed to demand crew to feed themselves to you, you are
allowed to tell them to go to your office for [disciplinary
actions](vore "wikilink"). Just make sure they don't scream, or you
could get in trouble.

Roleplaying Tips
----------------

-   In terms of roleplaying, you have a lot of freedom. You should
    really have some basic knowledge of how each department runs (NOT
    how to do them all), and who the heads of them are, but outside that
    you could really have as much (or as little) knowledge as you want.
    You can play with a background in a certain field, but you should
    NOT be able to do everything (i.e. Being able to set-up the Engine
    single-handedly AND also knowing how to clone people AND knowing how
    to make bombs is probably going too far). Just remember though, a
    very incompetent Colony Director doesn't make too many friends.
-   Leave Security matters to security, you don't (and shouldn't) need
    to step in on every criminal situation. You are above the Head of
    Security in terms of command, but you should defer security matters
    to him. Only step in if you think that a decision could endanger the
    station or crew.
    -   Do **NOT** run around the station with guns, chasing criminals.
        That's someone else's job
-   Don't think that just because you're the Colony Director, that you
    can do anything you want. That's the absolute **worst** thing to do.
    You're there to make sure everyone else is doing their job, not to
    do it for them.
-   Your armour is heavy protective armour that is space capable. It is
    not for walking around in all the time, and would be anywhere from
    extremely uncomfortable to debilitating exhausting depending on your
    Colony Director's physical strength and stamina to do so. There is
    an armoured vest in your locker if you absolutely feel the need to
    wear armour when the full set isn't appropriate, but keep in mind
    you're on a research station, and you shouldn't be expecting to
    really need the armour under the majority of situations.
