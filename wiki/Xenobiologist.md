#### Xenobiology

This laboratory specializes in the the study of alien lifeforms, such as
[slimes](slime "wikilink") and sometimes
[xenomorphs](xenomorph "wikilink").

Careful handling and caution if this lab is advised as it is common for
untrained personnel to inadvertently release the specimen. It is
important to make sure your flock is fed, and any extra unneeded slimes
culled to keep them from getting out of hand, it's also important to
make sure adult slimes are fed enough to split, or they'll make a mess
of their pens... Or you! Experiment on all sorts of fancy cores.
