The '''Librarian''' spends most of his or her time in the [[Library]] printing out books and lending them out. In practice, no one uses the library. Feel free to go and explore the station without fear of being yelled at. The [[Library]] itself has a permanence to its contents from game to game on the servers, all properly uploaded books can be downloaded in any other round.

This is more bane than blessing, since several titles that never should have seen the light of day are forever mingled in with the half decent books.

== Overview ==
You will be giving out books, on the rare occasion that someone requests a book. You will also be replacing the [[Chaplain]]'s  Bibles if need be. The final area of your job is to upload new books to the archive. So, take your [[pen]] and [[paper]], and write down some screenplays! Printing a few books is cool, but don't go and print 100 copies all in a pile. All it does is crash people that right-click it. You can also feel free to use the [[Newscaster]] (albeit so can everyone else), since you will likely have much free time on your hands.

== The Librarian and his [[Library]] ==
First things first, stock your [[Library]] with books that matter and tag the ones already there. At the start of the station, your bookshelf's will have some books, but they'll be quite disorganised. Your fellow crew members will not want to stay in a [[Library]] that has no books. To fix this use the [[Library]]'s Check In/Out Computer's and use its function, "4. Connect to External Archive". Here is the main dish of your sum total of existence, to sort out in the mess of books, and find only the BEST. The books are not sorted, or sortable, and look to have no order what so ever. You will even find many books hand copy's in the archive. To retrieve the selected book, simply order using that book's number, and the Check-In/Out Computer's printer will hum as it produces a completely bound book.

The barcode scanner will be needed for checking books into the local [[library]]'s computer. It has 4 settings they are as follows:

 Mode 0 : Scan book to local buffer.  <br>
 Mode 1 : Scan book to local buffer and set associated computer buffer to match.<br>
 Mode 2 : Scan book to local buffer, attempt to check in scanned book.<br>
 Mode 3 : Scan book to local buffer, attempt to add book to general inventory.<br>

(Note:Use the scanner on the computer, otherwise it wont work)<br>

The [[Library]] is not you workspace, but a home, to you and your books. Keep your books segregated, and sort them on their labelled book-shelves. Humour, Religious, Fiction, Self Help, Adult, and the back room's Forbidden Knowledge.

So! You're working on your novel, erotica, historical account, or "hard hitting investigative journalism", and you want it properly formatted and bound to be archived in the library for eternity. Here's how you do it. <br> 
1.First, grab a [[pen]] and [[paper]]. <br> 
2.Take the paper to the [[book binder]] and feed it in, keeping your pen handy. You'll get a blank book with a title like "Print Job #111" and no author, this is why you have your pen.
<br>
3.Click the book with the [[pen]] equipped, and you'll get a prompt to rename the book, provide an author, and write the content. Please [[Guide to Paperwork|properly format your story.]] Best practice is to attribute the writer of any work that's not yours! Whether this is the OOC writer of a lewdfic or the IC writer of metafiction (for instance, The Lusty Argonian Maid will be attributed to Crassius Curio) depends on context. Note that if you want fancy formatting and the font effect of your pen/crayon, you'll have to write the text first, then feed the paper into the bookbinder.<br> 
4.Now scan it into the local buffer with the [[Scanner]] Next to the [[Check in, Check out terminal]], and upload it to the archives on the [[check in/check out terminal]] for posterity.

== Traitoring ==
This is the hardest job as a traitor. However, if you are an expert at deconstruction and get a few good items, you shouldn't have TOO much difficulty, other than your terrible access. Emagging the [[library]] computer causes it to spit out an [[Arcane Tome|Arcane tome]]. You need to be a real cultist to read it though, so unless you are one, you can only use it to try to confuse Security.
