The **Paramedic** plays an extremely important role on board the
station. Primarily tasked with reaching injured crew members far from
medbay, every second counts and every action or inaction means the
difference between life and death. It is heavily advised you play as a
[Medical Intern](/wiki/Medical_Intern "wikilink") or an out-of-the-way
[Medical Doctor](/wiki/Medical_Doctor "wikilink") role regularly to
familiarize yourself with the practices of medbay before attempting the
job of paramedic. As a newer player, you'll want to change to the
alternate title **Emergency Medical Technician**. Paramedics are trained
in the medical field, but are not doctors, so they cannot reasonably
perform surgeries or advanced diagnostics. They're trained in detecting
and fixing, most of the time partially, symptoms found on the field and
in the art of triage.

Getting Set Up
--------------

A large part of the paramedic job is having all bases covered and
prepared before an actual call because once you get it, there is little
to no time to fetch any missing medicine or equipment. A good paramedic
must be able to stabilize a patient on the field, and reduce/stabilize
any critical damage to their body. A good paramedic must also be able to
reach all corners of the station as soon as possible, regardless of its
condition. The following items are recommended - necessary, even - to
operate effectively:

### Necessities

This equipment is **the minimum required** to be efficient during an
emergency.

-   ![](PGlasses.png "fig:PGlasses.png") A pair of [AR-M
    glasses](/wiki/Medical_Items#AR-M "wikilink") to get an estimate of
    someone's health from a glance, check their records, and view suit
    sensors.
-   ![](Healthanalyzer.png "fig:Healthanalyzer.png") A [health
    analyzer](/wiki/Medical_Items#Health_Analyzer "wikilink") for basic but
    *very* necessary diagnosis of injuries.

    Inaprovaline](/wiki/Guide_to_Chemistry#Medicine "wikilink") bottles to
    draw from to stabilize and treat basic injuries.
-   ![](AMed.png "fig:AMed.png") An [advanced
    kit](/wiki/Medical_Items#Advanced_Medical_Kit "wikilink") placed in your
    backpack, along with other kits to make up for whatever isn't in the
    chemistry fridge. You probably spawned with one.
-   ![](Rollerbed.png "fig:Rollerbed.png") A [roller
    bed](/wiki/Medical_Items#Roller_Bed "wikilink") to transport patients
    quickly without dragging. Toss it in your backpack.

    bag](/wiki/Medical_Items#Stasis_Bag "wikilink") to transport critical
    patients to medbay.

### Additional Equipment

More equipment found around medbay or medicines made by a
[Chemist](/wiki/Chemist "wikilink") may greatly improve your chances of saving
lives and preventing unnecessary damage.

-   ![](LGloves.png "fig:LGloves.png") A pair of [latex or nitrile
    gloves](/wiki/Medical_Items#Latex_Gloves "wikilink") to prevent spreading
    infection.

-   ![](Hspray.png "fig:Hspray.png") A
    [hypospray](/wiki/Medical_Items#Hypospray "wikilink") loaded with a
    stabilization mix.
-   ![](Inflatables.png "fig:Inflatables.png") A [box of
    inflatables](/wiki/Engineering_Items#Inflatable_Barrier_Box "wikilink") to
    get into dangerous areas safely and without spreading danger to
    anywhere else.

Responding to an Emergency
--------------------------

Now that you're all prepped and ready, it's only a waiting game until
your first emergency arises. Whether by monitoring [suit
sensors](/wiki/Suit_sensors#Jumpsuits "wikilink") or a radio call, you'll have
a name and a place. Rush to the scene as soon as you can, making sure
you're equipped with your voidsuit if the area is depressurized. Once on
scene, you will need to stabilize your patient before moving him/her to
medbay depending on the state he is in.

### Non-Critical Patient

If the call you've responded to is non-critical (the patient is fully
conscious, stable, and/or health above 0) then all you need to do is
diagnose the specific problem and administer the necessary medicine on
the field. It is advised, however; to bring the patient back to medbay
for a more thorough check. Nonetheless, you will find yourself
performing several of the steps found in the next section, but with much
less urgency, which means less medicine used on the patient which can be
treated by [Medical Doctors](/wiki/Medical_Doctor "wikilink").

### Critical Patients

Dealing with critical patients is a bit more tricky. More likely than
not, you'll find critical patients (health below 0) are unconscious or
otherwise unable to communicate. This will make finding the exact cause
of the problem unlikely - if you're new - in the field, which will
require that you transport the patient to the medical bay post-haste.
But before that, a series of steps are required to make sure your
patient doesn't die on the way. The steps are listed in order of
importance.

-   Scan the patient with your health analyzer. Seriously, this should
    be the first step to literally anything.
-   Administer Inaprovaline to the critical patient to make sure his
    situation doesn't worsen.
-   If the patient is bleeding, apply a trauma kit to the affected area
    as soon as possible to stop the bleeding.
-   If the patient is suffocating, administer Dexalin to counteract the
    hypoxia.
-   If the patient has/had an open wound, it is advised you apply an
    advanced burn kit to kill any infection at the stem. This is a
    preemptive measure, and unnecessary unless you believe the patient
    is in such a dismal condition that you can't afford any more risks.
    You are <s>unable</s> completely capable of detecting infections on
    the field by means of observing their temperature, or by examining
    the potential area of infection if it has progressed to dangerous
    stages.
-   Treat any remaining burn, brute, or toxin damage with the
    application of advanced kits, pills, or injections to further
    improve the state of the patient.
-   Administer Tramadol if the patient is suffering from pain-causing
    symptoms. Patients in shock are less communicative which might
    hamper your ability to diagnose the problem.
-   Finally, splint any fractures before wheeling the patient away on a
    roller bed.

It may be in good taste to inquire the patient about their status. If
they can speak clearly, good job!

On arrival, make sure you brief any doctor that will handle your patient
on what you administered and what their symptoms are. Failure to do so
may result in an angsty nurse repeating the treatments that you've
already conducted which may lead to an overdose.

What to Do When Out of Emergencies?
-----------------------------------

Paramedics, being non-doctors trained in the medical field, can assume
other roles around the medbay to make MD's lives easier and improve
overall efficiency of the medical bay, basically acting as a glorified
nurse.

-   Help move patients from one branch of the medbay to another.
-   Monitor the reception area, monitor suit sensors.
-   Handle [triage](/wiki/Guide_to_Medicine#Triage "wikilink"), stabilizing
    patients who were left waiting.
-   Check up on patients who were moved to the sub-acute/recovery ward.
-   Simply ask doctors what you can do to help.

**Don't.**

Roleplay Tips
-------------

-   Remember that paramedics are *not* doctors, much to the contrary of
    what everyone seems to say when thanking you, *if* they thank you.
    Keep that in mind, and use it to give an interesting edge to your
    character. Think like a paramedic would, not a doctor. Asking
    questions a doctor would consider 'silly' is perfectly fine for you.
-   Paramedics are trained on urgency and that every second counts,
    unlike the MDs who had to spend over a decade studying to start
    practicing. That contract between your coworkers and you can be used
    to enhance RP.
