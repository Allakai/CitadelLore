So you signed up to be a drone, eh? Unlike other servers, drones do not have access to the cameras. Better memorize the vent layout! You have laws against interaction with the crew, as well as improving the station. If there are no breaches, work in any area, improving it, by changing flooring, etc, so long as it doesn't interfere with the crew's working. If you wanted to, you could TECHNICALLY build your own station on the same Z-Level. Though why would [[index.php?title=Traitor&action=edit&redlink=1|anyone]] want to do that?
