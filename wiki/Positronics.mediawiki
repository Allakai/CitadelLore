Positronics is the field of constructing positronic substrates and circuitry to allow for the production of mundane to sentient AIs. Whereas silicon-based AI is programmed to engage in desired behaviour, positronic AI must be lawed to prevent undesired behaviour, except where the positronic substrate is programmed to behave simply as more compact silicon.
