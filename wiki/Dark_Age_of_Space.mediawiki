The name Gaians have given for an era of space travel between the 2220s and 2240s in which the black market of organs in the Koi Starzone was thriving in the colonies unbeknownst to the Federation-Alliance government. The thriving underground economy was due to the harsh environments the colonists had to endure in space. 

The name comes from the harsher reality of the black market network, that being the string of kidnappings conducted for fresh organs and biological material for lab-grown organs. 

Government records have ended it officially in 2243 when a squad of police officers arrest a colony governor and his corporate executive benefactor for heading the network responsible for the black market. Historians would argue that the age truly ends in 2294 when a Project Jasher colonist springs genetics research forward.
