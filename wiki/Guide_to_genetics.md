The Department
--------------

Ready to play with the human genome? Good! Because it's about to get
very interesting.

The Genetics department is in Medbay. It has a pen full of monkeys, some
cloning equipment, and a couple of DNA modifiers for experiments. This
is where you'll be spending most of your time.

Cloning
-------

Cloning is one of the main aspects of your job. Bringing people back
from the dead is a delicate science, so read on. The [Chief Medical
Officer](/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer "wikilink") has the final say about what
happens here, rather than the [Research
Director](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink").

You can clone people from scans made while they are alive and well
(which is preferred), or from a corpse (which happens more often than
not). Feel free to call people to get their backups made, especially for
Heads of Staff.

Cloning consumes biomass, 150 points per clone. The cloning pod starts
with 450 points and you can get more biomass by feeding meat to the
machine (any type of meat works). Each meat slab adds 50 points.

### Scan

The first thing that a clone needs is a record in the cloning console.
Scanning requires a dead or live human body with its brain still in
place (monkeys or decapitated corpses won't work), whereas making the
actual clone requires the person to be dead.

1.  Make sure the person is not wearing anything. (Optional)
    -   If the person is alive, have them strip.
    -   If the person is dead, click+drag their body onto yours to bring
        up their clothing window, then click on the links identifying
        each piece of clothing to remove it.
2.  ![](Grab.png "fig:Grab.png") Grab the person.
3.  Click on the ![](Scanner.gif "fig:Scanner.gif") DNA scanner to place
    them inside.
4.  Click on the ![](Cloning_console.gif "fig:Cloning_console.gif")
    cloning console to bring up its menu.
5.  Click **Scan**.
6.  Click **View Records** to make sure their record is listed in the
    cloning database.

### Making the Clone

Remember, a clone can only be made when the person you're making a clone
for is dead and logged in. If they aren't dead or have logged out,
you'll see an "Unable to initiate cloning cycle" error in the Cloning
System Control.

1.  Head to the ![](Cloning_console.gif "fig:Cloning_console.gif")
    cloning console beside the ![](Clone.gif "fig:Clone.gif") cloning
    pod, and click on it to open its menu.
2.  Click **View Records**, select the person you wish to clone, then
    click **Clone**.
3.  Make sure the cloning pod has enough biomass to produce a clone.
    Each clone consumes 150 biomass points.
    -   *Note: After clicking "Clone" the dead person will get a pop-up
        window asking if they want to come back to life. If they choose
        "No", the console will say "Unable to initiate cloning cycle".
        If they choose "Yes", the console will say "Cloning cycle
        activated", and their body will be remade in a few minutes.
        **You do not need to ask in OOC. Doing this is now considered IC
        in OOC.***
    -   *Note \#2: When a new clone is made, that person's record is
        deleted from the database, so they must be
        [scanned](/wiki/Geneticist#Scan "wikilink") again if they are to be
        cloned a second time. You can use diskettes to save a record of
        their backup.*

### Finishing a New Clone

1.  Grab the new clone and take it to Cryo, the room with large
    ![](Cryo.gif "fig:Cryo.gif") cryo cells.
2.  Click on one of the cells to place the clone inside and set the
    **Cryo status** to **On**.
3.  Take a nearby ![](Beaker.png "fig:Beaker.png") beaker filled with
    Cryoxadone and then click on the same cell you placed the clone in
    to load the beaker into the cell. Note that Clonexadone heals them
    faster and should be used when possible. Get some from the
    [Chemist](/wiki/Chemist "wikilink").
4.  Use the nearby ![](Wrench.png "fig:Wrench.png") wrench on both
    ![](O2_canister.png "fig:O2_canister.png") O2 canisters to secure
    them (if they aren't already).
5.  Set the ![](Freezer.gif "fig:Freezer.gif") freezer's **Target gas
    temperature** to its lowest amount by clicking on the far-left "-"
    until the number in the center no longer decreases.
6.  Set the freezer to **On**.
    -   ''Note: At this point, the clone will begin to heal slowly if
        cryo was set up correctly, shown by the increasing health
        indication in the cryo cell's menu.
7.  Click on the cryo cell to check on your clone. When its health
    reaches 100, it is considered finished and can then be ejected
    (right-click &gt; Eject Occupant).
8.  **Don't forget!** when you're done with the cryo room, turn the cryo
    cells to **Off** so you don't waste Oxygen! Also, if you still have
    their old body, drag it to the [Morgue](/wiki/Morgue "wikilink") for
    proper storage.
9.  Clones may often suffer from brain damages, once they're removed
    from the cryo cell, make sure to inject them with Alkysine if they
    suffer from this.

DNA Modification
----------------

Let's start with a quick practical example to learn how to be a
Geneticist, and to learn what you should do at the start of every round:

1.  ![](Grab.png "fig:Grab.png") Grab one of the monkeys from the pen.
2.  Click on a ![](Scanner.gif "fig:Scanner.gif") DNA Modifier to stuff
    the monkey inside.
3.  Click on the ![](Cloning_console.gif "fig:Cloning_console.gif") DNA
    Modifier Access Console to open its menu.
4.  Click **Modify Structural Enzymes**.
5.  Click **Block** and enter the number of the last block - 27.
6.  Click **Radiation** continuously until the first sub-block in block
    27 has a number *less* than 8.
    -   (Optional) After this step is done, you can right-click the DNA
        Modifier and **Eject DNA Scanner** to remove the monkey. It
        looks human!
7.  Glance at all of the 1st sub-blocks (the first character) of all 27
    blocks and make sure they are all less than 8.
    -   If any blocks are higher than 8, move to it using the arrow
        links, then radiate it until it is lower than 8.
8.  Click **Main Menu**, then click **View/Edit/Transfer Buffer**.
9.  In the first Buffer section - Buffer 1 - click **SE** to save the
    Structural Enzymes of that monkey.
10. Click **Edit Label** and enter *Clean*.
11. Click **Injector** to create a syringe with that monkey's genetic
    DNA inside it.
    -   The syringe will spawn on top of the DNA Modifier Access
        Console. Click on it to pick it up.
12. Store your syringe in a place you'll remember (backpack or pocket is
    fine).

You now have a way of reverting your genes to a clean set without
disabilities or powers. This will be extremely useful for all future
genetic alterations you do to yourself or others in case you make any
mistakes. To inject yourself, simply put the injector in an open hand
and click on yourself. Your Structural Enzymes will immediately become
like the ones in the injector.

### Hexadecimals

The number format in each block is a
[Hexadecimal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal). In summary, the
numbers and letters are organized like this, from lowest to highest:

<font color=#FF000>**0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F**</font>

Each **block** has 3 **sub-blocks** of hexadecimals. For the purpose of
this instruction, saying to set a specific block "below 800" means that
the first sub-block of that block must be less than 8 - the other two
characters in that block don't matter. In another example, setting a
block to "above DAC" means:

-   The first sub-block must be equal to or higher than D (E or F)
-   The second sub-block must be equal to or higher than A (B, C, D, E,
    or F)
-   The third sub-block must be equal to or higher than C (D, E, or F)

*Note: If the first sub-block is E or F, you can stop, since (for
example) E00 is higher than DAC. For this reason, it is usually
recommended to simply radiate the first sub-block and to leave the other
two sub-blocks alone.*

### Unique Identifiers (UI)

Unique Identifiers are your cosmetic details - eye color, skin color,
hair style, hair color and gender. All colors are in RBG, with 0 meaning
absence of that color, and F meaning the highest value of that color.

#### Blocks 1-3

1 - Hair color R 2 - Hair color B 3 - Hair Color G

#### Blocks 4-6

4 - Eye color R 5 - Eye color B 6 - Eye color G

#### Block 7

7 - Skin tone 1(0)-220(F)

#### Blocks 8-10

8 - Beard Color R 9 - Beard Color B 10 - Beard Color G

#### Block 11

11 - Gender

-   &lt; 800 = Male
-   &gt; 800 = Female

#### Block 12-13

12 - Beard Style 13 - Hair Style

### Unique Enzymes (UE)

Unique enzymes determine your identity, basically the name that people
see you as when they examine you, and when you talk. These are separate
from unique identifiers, but usually changed together.

### Structural Enzymes (SE)

Structural Enzymes contain data relevant to your genetic structure. This
governs your race, powers, and disabilities. For those that handle genes
with care, however, great benefits are to be had.

#### Blocks 1 - 26

These are all randomized powers (minor and major) or disabilities.

#### Block 27

This block governs the race of the subject.

-   Human = below 800
-   Monkey = above 800

Powers and Disabilities
-----------------------

Any of blocks 1-26 may be the block for a special power or disability.
Powers and disabilities are calculated at round-start, thus are not
different for each person.

#### Minor Powers

<s>All minor powers need to have a block above **802** to work and each
has a **50%** probability of manifesting when applied. This means that
you may have the correct block, but still not cause the power to appear.
Reapplication is necessary in this case.

-   **No Breathing**: *You feel no need to breathe*. You do not require
    oxygen to breathe.
-   **Remote Viewing**: *Your mind expands*. You can remotely observe
    other people.
-   **Quickness**: *You feel quick*. You do **NOT** move faster than
    normal. However, you are unencumbered by space suits or anything
    else that slows you down.
-   **Telepathic Communication**: *You expand your mind outwards*. You
    can talk to people through their minds over long distances.
-   **Morphing**: *Your skin feels strange*. You can change your
    appearance at will.
-   **Alone**: *You feel alone*. Does nothing. You loner.
-   **No Fingerprints**: *Your fingers feel numb*. You leave no
    fingerprints.
-   **Small Size**: *Your skin feels rubbery*. You can climb on tables
    and hide under them.
-   **Regeneration**: *You feel strange*. You can regenerate health
    faster.</s>

#### Major Powers

These require a block of **DAC** or higher to activate with the % chance
of manifesting in () parenthesis.

-   <s>**Shock Immunity** (50%): *You feel strange*. You are immune to
    shocks. This message can also mean other things, so be careful.</s>
-   **Temperature Resistance** (30%): *Your body feels warm*. You aren't
    affected by temperatures. <s>This, combined with "No Breathing",
    means you can walk in space without equipment.</s>
-   **X-Ray Vision** (30%): *The walls suddenly disappear*. You can see
    everything in your sight range, even through walls. Combined with
    Telekinesis, this makes you a force to be reckoned with.
-   **Telekinesis** (15%): *You feel smarter*. Allows you to move
    objects with your mind and affect things in your sight range.
-   **Hulk** (5%): *Your muscles hurt*. You turn green and become super
    strong. You can't be stunned and your punches can break through
    reinforced walls. You will lose this power and can collapse if you
    get below 25% health.

#### Disabilities

As tempting as those powers may seem, there is also a very high chance
of you getting a disability. These always manifest when the block is at
**802** or higher.

-   **Coughing**: *You start coughing*. You cough a lot and drop things
    when you do so.
-   **Deafness**: *It's kinda quiet..* You can't hear anything.
-   **Short Sightedness**: *Your eyes feel weird...* You have reduced
    vision, and require glasses, medicine, carrots or surgery to see
    better.
-   **Blindness**: *You can't seem to see anything*. The most
    debilitating mutation. You can't see or interact with anything.
    You'll need someone else to help you.
-   **Clumsiness**: *You feel lightheaded*. You drop things a lot, are
    generally clumsy, and guns explode in your face. Very debilitating.
-   **Strangeness**: *You feel strange*. You start randomly mutating.
    Very dangerous.

Modifying the Genome
--------------------

Continuing from the above [ practical
example](/wiki/Guide_to_Genetics#DNA_Modification "wikilink") with the monkey
(that now looks human) still inside the
![](Scanner.gif "fig:Scanner.gif") DNA Modifier, you have a few options
on how to change the monkey's genes:

-   **Radiation Emitter Settings**
    -   Change how long and how harshly the monkey gets blasted by
        radiation. Default settings are adequate.
-   **Pulse Radiation** (Main Menu)
    -   Inaccurately and randomly modify any of the monkey's UI or SE
        with a single pulse.
-   **Radiation** (Inside the **Modify Unique Identifier** or **Modify
    Structural Enzymes** sub-menus).
    -   Accurately modify a single sub-block.

The idea is to start at Block 1 of the Structural Enzymes and radiate
that block until the number is "DAC" or higher. Then, remove your monkey
and see if anything seems strange with him. The catch is - not all
disabilities or powers are easily visible. For a dangerous disability
like Blindness, you can check your monkey's eyes to make sure their
pupils narrow with the penlight you should have:

1.  Move the penlight to an open hand.
2.  Click on the penlight to turn it "On".
3.  Click on the ![](Damage_zone.png "fig:Damage_zone.png") Damage Zone
    in the top-right corner of your HUD to indicate that you want to
    target the **eyes**.
4.  Click on the monkey to "direct the penlight" into their eyes.
    -   If you see "pupils narrow", the monkey's eyes are normal. An
        "eerie glow" means X-Ray Vision, and "no reaction" means the
        monkey is blind.

If you notice something wrong with your monkey, like twitching, you know
that block is a disability. Make a note of it, then **Radiation** that
block until it's back below 800 to make it normal again. You can also
use your injector, or Transfer Buffer &gt; Transfer to &gt; Occupant.
Both the injector and occupant-transfer cause a small amount of toxin
damage (about 4-5, which can be identified by the occupant's **Health
%**) and between 20-50% radiation (identified by the **Radiation Level
%**). The radiation level can be reduced by using **Inject
Rejuvenators**, and the toxin damage can be cured by using the pills or
syringes contained within the
![](First_aid_anti_toxin.png "fig:First_aid_anti_toxin.png") Anti-Toxin
First Aid kit on your subject.

Then, continue down the line of blocks until you have a structural
enzyme string of only powers with zero disabilities. Saving this buffer
is highly recommended unless you don't want someone else to find it (in
which case, you could edit the label to something like "All
disabilities" to fool people).

#### Example Scenario

1.  Block 1 is radiated to DAC
2.  Monkey is removed to check for disabilities, but appears to be
    clean.
3.  Geneticist saves the monkey's SE, outputs it into an injector, and
    injects himself to see what the block does.
4.  Nothing happens.

*Notes: This is a good sign. Because disabilities have a 100% of
manifesting above 800, having nothing happen means two things: A) The
block is either a minor or major power, and B) You will find the power
if you continue to radiate block 1 above DAC. See the above [ percentage
chances](/wiki/Guide_to_Genetics#Powers_and_Disabilities "wikilink") that a
power will manifest while continuing to radiate that same block above
the required hexadecimal.*

### Random Mutations

At all times, there is a chance that radiating a specific sub-block will
not work. Instead, a different random sub-block will be radiated.
Furthermore, this chance increases as your subject's **Radiation Level**
increases. This is most identifiable then you radiate a sub-block, but
it doesn't change, in which case either:

-   (Likely) A different, random sub-block of either Unique Identifiers
    or Structural Enzymes has been modified.
-   (Unlikely) The radiated sub-block just happened to land on the same
    number.

This can be easier to control by using **Inject Rejuvenators**, which
will slowly lower the monkey's **Radiation Level**. Only 90 units of
rejuvenation are allowed in the subject. Rejuvenator overdoses do not
negatively affect the subject at this time, so it is recommended to keep
your subject on Rejuvenators while radiating them to ensure that
radiation levels immediately and continuously decrease.

Due to this chance of random mutations, you must get in the habit of
"cleaning the SE", which involves reading over the first sub-block of
every block in the Structural Enzymes to make sure that no other blocks
are over 800. For example, if you're testing block 1 and you finally got
it above DAC, your process to do so may have inadvertently modified
block 2 to 900 (which would cause a disability or a minor power). This
would make it difficult to determine what block 1 is doing to your
monkey.

### Cleaning

In order to "clean" a subject of unwanted disabilities or powers, the
key is to make ALL of the Structural Enzymes blocks that you want to be
normal *less than* 800. Unfortunately, this can be challenging, as
radiating the subject too much will likely cause random blocks to
change, making your effort infinite if their radiation level is not kept
in check with Rejuvenators.

### Transfer Buffer

The Transfer Buffer is a useful tool for saving your work, though it is
always recommended that you take written notes on each block as you
modify them. Furthermore, as stated in the [ practical
example](/wiki/Guide_to_Genetics#DNA_Modification "wikilink"), it is highly
recommended to keep a clean buffer saved just in case.

-   Save
    -   UI (Unique Identifiers)
    -   UI+UE (Unique Identifiers and Unique Enzymes)
    -   SE (Structural Enzymes)
-   Transfer To
    -   Occupant - Transfers the saved data from that buffer into your
        subject in the ![](Scanner.gif "fig:Scanner.gif") DNA Modifier.
        Causes a large amount of radiation to blast the subject.
    -   Injector - Creates a syringe that you can carry around with you
        to inject yourself or others. Causes a small amount of toxin
        damage, but requires time to produce new injectors..
-   Disk - Take a disk from the nearby Diskette Box and click on the
    ![](Cloning_console.gif "fig:Cloning_console.gif") DNA Modifier
    Access Console to load it.
    -   Save To - Saves the data from that buffer to the disk.
    -   Load From - Loads data from an existing disk into the DNA
        Modifier Access Console.
    -   Eject Disk (Main Menu) - Remove the disk.
