Starter Guides (listed above) as well as the [Job
Guides](/wiki/Job_Guides "wikilink").

Space Station 13 is a multiplayer roleplaying game developed using the
[BYOND](http://www.byond.com/) engine. In Space Station 13 (from here on
to be referred to as SS13 or VORE, short for "Virgo Orbital Research
Establishment," our specific variant), players take the role of workers
on a space station. There are many different jobs available, and each
player chooses and plays a role in the space station.

Let's get one thing out of the way from the start. **[WE EAT PEOPLE AND
GET OFF ON IT](/wiki/Guide_to_Vore "wikilink").** You may want to read the
[Mission Statement](/wiki/Mission_Statement "wikilink"). If you don't like
that kind of thing, or you don't like erotic roleplay in your
spacestations, you can always
[play](https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Main_Page)
[somewhere](http://wiki.baystation12.net/)
[else](http://nanotrasen.se/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).

**Vorestation is a heavily
[roleplay](/wiki/A_Crash_Course_in_Roleplaying "wikilink")-focused server. The
choice is not optional; it is enforced. Should you be new to
roleplaying, consult [A Crash Course in
Roleplaying](/wiki/A_Crash_Course_in_Roleplaying "wikilink"). Should you still
have questions, ask them at the [Vorestation
forum.](http://forum.vore-station.net)**

The Rules
---------

Yes, there are [rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink") set in place to ensure an
enjoyable experience for all players. Please take a moment and read
them. If you're extra worried, you can also read about how [not to get
banned.](/wiki/Not_Getting_Banned "wikilink")

What to Expect
--------------

What to expect from VOREStation:

-   \~ADULT CONTENT\~ WEW
-   A large, evolving community of players
-   Dynamic roleplaying over several-hours-long ‘shifts’
-   Creating an ongoing story for your character (shifts have story
    continuity between them)
-   A flexible setting to allow you to create a diverse array of
    characters to play
-   A game to play while socializing, meeting new people, and enjoying
    yourself
-   People who will accept you for who you are, and what you’re into
-   The ability to duck into a dorm for isolated ‘anything goes’ RP\*
-   Staff-driven storyline events involving the playerbase as characters

What to **NOT** expect from VOREStation:

-   A high-action SS13 server with 24/7 robusting
-   Antag rounds (anags are/can be manually assigned by admins)
-   The ability to create characters which do not fit into the setting
    (without approval)
-   A place to have every roleplay you want, at any time, anywhere,
    without restriction\*\*
-   A private chatroom where your roleplaying has no chance of being
    interrupted or seen by others
-   Roleplaying with just your friends from other places
-   Playing as specific characters from other licensed media
-   'Anything goes' refers to the fact that you can roleplay things that
    do not fit in the setting, or things you would usually be quickly
    arrested for, not that you can ignore the server’s rules.
    -   Do not expect to be able to perform illegal acts in public or
        create scenarios that don’t fit within the setting without
        repercussions from other characters, or possibly admins.

Joining the Server
------------------

To join the server you'll need to follow a couple of steps:

1.  Download the BYOND client from
    [here](http://www.byond.com/download/). You'll need it to start
    playing
2.  Register for a BYOND account
    [here](https://secure.byond.com/?page=Join).
3.  Add this server to your bookmarks, or just join manually using the
    BYOND client. byond://vore-station.net:2303

If all has gone well, congratulations! You're on the server! Before you
can jump in and start playing, we strongly recommend you set up your
character first.

Character Setup
---------------

<figure>
<img src="CharacterSetup.png" title="The character setup screen." alt="The character setup screen." width="600" /><figcaption>The character setup screen.</figcaption>
</figure>

Before you start throwing together a character, make sure you glance at
[Special character
application](/wiki/Special_character_application "wikilink") so that you know
what types of characters are generally unacceptable and require a
special application before playing. If in doubt, ask.

### Cosmetics

Cosmetics have no actual effect on gameplay, but we recommend that you
take some time to change them to your taste.

-   **Name:** As part of the [roleplay
    guidelines](/wiki/Rules#Roleplay "wikilink") followed by the server, it is
    required that all characters have a first and last name (with the
    exception of different languages or cultures, but use common
    sense!). By randomizing your name, the game will pick a suitable
    name for your character, accounting for gender.
-   **Gender:** Self-explanatory; this is purely for roleplay purposes.
-   **Age:** The only cosmetic setting that is basically useless. It
    will only appear on in-game security and medical records and won't
    change your character's appearance. The only other effect is has is
    the Skill System.

### Look and Feel

-   **UI Style:** Your user interface theme. You have the choice of
    *Orange* or *Midnight*, newer, sleeker layouts which differ only in
    their color scheme, and *Old*, a familiar legacy theme that
    preserves the 'traditional' Space Station 13 feel. There is now also
    a "White" theme. This theme is mostly for crafting your own UI.
-   **Play admin midis:** If enabled, you will be able to hear music
    played by admins. Usually best to leave it enabled, as you can turn
    it off in-game and admins will rarely play MIDIs.
-   **Ghost ears/Ghost sight/radio:** When you're dead or observing,
    these determine whether you hear speech and see actions,
    respectively, from anywhere in the world, or only from the area
    on-screen. (These can also be changed in-game.)

  
*All of these setting are capable of being changed in-game through the
preferences and ghost tabs on the right-hand side of your screen.*

### Occupations

This is an important option and will be covered in more detail below.

### Skills

The skills settings here have no actual effect on gameplay — only
roleplay — but give you a framework to define your character's
knowledge, skills and experience. It's best to leave these alone until
you're familiar with the various aspects of Space Station 13. These are
covered in more detail on the [Skill System](/wiki/Skill_System "wikilink")
page. Don't gives skills unrealistic values if you don't plan on using
the system, just leave them alone. It makes the mod's/admin's jobs
easier.

### Appearance

-   **Body:** Pressing the (®) will give you a completely random
    appearance. Can produce some pretty strange results, so it's not
    recommended (unless you happen to like playing a bald woman with an
    enormous purple beard).
-   **Species:** This option will allow you to change your
    [Species](/wiki/Species "wikilink"). There are a number of
    [Species](/wiki/Species "wikilink") that you can encounter. Some of them
    will likely be unavailable to you however, such as Vox, Diona, and
    Xenomorph Hybrid.
-   **Blood Type:** Blood type isn't important until your character is
    injured; he or she can only give or accept blood transfusions from
    people with a compatible blood type.
-   **Body Color:** This will change your character's skin color. You
    can use one of the presets, or define your own custom color using
    the custom tab in the window that pops up.
-   **Underwear:** Changes the color of your character's underwear,
    visible when naked. Even if set to *none*, nothing particularly
    explicit is shown.
-   **Backpack:** You can choose between a standard gray backpack, two
    different types of satchels (one brown leather, the other
    department-specific design and color), or none at all.
-   **Hair/Facial/Eyes**: These let you change the color and, if
    applicable, style of your character's hair, facial hair, and eyes.
    Hair and facial hair styles can be changed regardless of gender. Use
    common sense, though: red eyes and bearded women aren't really a
    good idea.

### Disabilities

Allows you to set disabilities for you character to start with. Not
recommended. See [Disabilities](/wiki/Disabilities "wikilink") for more
information.

### Flavor Text

This blurb is shown when people examine you (see
[Controls](/wiki/General_Help "wikilink") for more information).

This text should only describe your character's physical traits and
mannerisms. It's not a good idea to mention anything someone wouldn't
know by looking at you or something that is opinionated (e.g. "has long
brown hair" or "has a gruff look" rather than "is extremely beautiful"
or "has problems with authority").

### Character Records

This will pop-up a window that will allow you to set your character
Medical and Security records, and have them be able to be read in-game
by [Medical Doctors](/wiki/Medical_Doctor "wikilink") or [Security
Officers](/wiki/Security_Officer "wikilink") respectively.

This is mostly a fun little RP tool that can be used to help flesh out
your character more. However, since it appears in-game as an official
record, it should be written as such. Try to write it as you would
expect from a large company like NanoTrasen.

Do not put your records in your Flavor Text. Flavor Text is meant for
your **physical description**

There is also the "Employment Records" which can show your character's
past occupation history.

Not recommended for newer players.

### Antagonist Options

These will put you in the running for the role of various antagonists.
**As a new player, it is *strongly* recommended that you set all of
these options to *no* until you have had the opportunity to play the
various [game modes](game_mode "wikilink") as a normal crewman. Should
you be chosen to play an antagonist without wanting to, tell an admin
via Adminhelp that you are new and do not wish to do so.**

The only exception is **pAI candidate**, which will give you the chance
to play as a [Personal AI](/wiki/Personal_AI "wikilink"). You can safely leave
this enabled, since you can still reject it in-game.

### Data Management

You can save your character and preferences for future rounds by
clicking the save button at the bottom on the window. Doing so will
allow you to play that character over different rounds.

You can also add more character slots by click the 'Create New
Character' link. You have quite a few, so try experimenting with
different characters and personalities!

Occupations, Revisited
----------------------

<figure>
<img src="JobPanel.png" title="The job preferences panel." alt="The job preferences panel." width="300" /><figcaption>The job preferences panel.</figcaption>
</figure>

Your occupation is, by far, one of the most important settings in the
game. It affects your station access, rank, authority, equipment, and
purpose in life. These range from civilian jobs such as
[Chefs](/wiki/Chef "wikilink") or [Janitors](/wiki/Janitor "wikilink"), all the way
up to the [Head of Personnel](/wiki/Head_of_Personnel "wikilink") or the
[Captain](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink").

### Job Assignment

With the exception of Assistant, all job preferences have four levels:
*Never*, *Low*, *Medium*, and *High*. These change how likely the server
is to assign you that job when it compares your preferences with those
of the other players.

Because of the diversity and range of jobs available, there are many
ways to roleplay. A lot of these jobs, however, require a good knowledge
of the game mechanics, the layout of the station, and how to use in-game
tools and machinery. Because of this, the following jobs are recommended
for new players:

-   **[Assistant](/wiki/Assistant "wikilink"):** The most basic of all
    occupations, the assistant has no authority and, generally speaking,
    no responsibilities. It's an excellent opportunity to learn the game
    mechanics — but your access is limited, so feel free to ask other
    people if you can help, and they'll usually be happy to show you
    around their department and help you learn the ropes. It also lets
    you practice roleplaying, if you're still unsure about it.

<!-- -->

-   **[Janitor](/wiki/Janitor "wikilink"):** A simple, if menial, job that
    involves replacing lightbulbs, cleaning up messes, putting out wet
    floor signs, and then pointing them out to people who've slipped on
    the floor you just finished mopping. Your only responsibilities are
    to keep the station clean and well-lit, and it'll help you learn
    your way around the station and its various departments.

<!-- -->

-   **[Chef](/wiki/Chef "wikilink"):** A fairly simple job that gives you a
    good introduction to mixing ingredients, and there's even the
    possibility of cake into the bargain. Recipes are available
    [here](/wiki/Guide_to_Food_and_Drink "wikilink"), to help kickstart a
    budding Chef's career.

<!-- -->

-   **[Bartender](/wiki/Bartender "wikilink"):** Like the Chef, but with more
    alcohol. The Barman's job is primarily mixing and serving drinks to
    a thirsty crew. The recipes are also available
    [here](/wiki/Guide_to_Food_and_Drink "wikilink"). You'd be surprised at
    some of the stuff you can make, so try it out!

If you're interested in other jobs, feel free to browse the [Job
Guides](/wiki/Job_Guides "wikilink"). Try to avoid any Security, Engineering,
or Command positions until you get a hang of the game. (Jumping into a
position you're not prepared to do is a guaranteed way of making people
angry at you.)

Playing the Game
----------------

If all has gone well, you should be just about ready to play your first
round, and you'll be entering one of two ways:

### Starting the Round

![The joining (Bottom-Left), character setup(Right), and main
panel(Top-Left).](MidgameWindow.png "The joining (Bottom-Left), character setup(Right), and main panel(Top-Left).")

Each round starts with a 3-minute delay while players chat and set up
their characters. If you're lucky enough to join at this point, the
first thing to do is set up your character's appearance and job
preferences, then click *Ready*.

More than likely, however, you'll arrive halfway through a game in
progress. Clicking **View Crew Manifest** will give you a list of who's
on the station, and what position they have filled. When you join the
game, you'll have the opportunity to choose from a list of available
positions.

When joining a game in progress, you'll spawn on the *Arrivals Shuttle*
(or your character's selected method of entry), and will be introduced
to the crew by the Arrivals Announcement Computer. From there, you can
either try to find your workplace and get started, or just explore the
station a bit.

### Gameplay

#### The User Interface

![This is how the HUD looks when you first hop into Space Station
13](HUD.png "This is how the HUD looks when you first hop into Space Station 13")

-   **1. Clothing(2):** Anything your character is wearing. Clicking the
    backpack icon on the bottom left will show/hide this menu.
-   **2. Hands(3):** The items you're holding in your hands. The hand
    you're currently using will be highlighted, and you can switch hands
    by clicking the appropriate hand or clicking 'Swap'. (Keyboard
    shortcut: **Page-Up**)
    -   If you wish to open objects with their own storage (while their
        in your inventory), simply move them to one hand, and click on
        them with an empty hand.
    -   If you want to quickly equip an item, hold it in your active
        hand and press the E next to Swap.
-   **3. Pockets(1):** Your jumpsuit has pockets, and anything in them
    is displayed here. You won't be able to use them if you're naked.
-   **4. Actions(4):**
    -   **Throw:** Toggle throwing; you can then throw the item in your
        active hand by clicking something to throw it at. (Top-right)
        (Keyboard shortcut: **End**)
    -   **Drop:** Immediately let go of the item you're holding. (Left
        of **Throw**) (Keyboard shortcut: **Home**)
    -   **Resist** Resist against restraints and grabs. (Left of
        **Drop**)
    -   **Let Go:** You can pull people and some items by shift-clicking
        on them; if you're pulling something, click this button to
        release it. (Left of **Resist**, depending on your settings it
        may only appear when you've grabbed onto something)
-   **5. Target, Speed, and Intent(4):**
    -   **Body Target:** Shows which part of the body you will interact
        with, whether helping or harming. To change this, click on the
        different parts of the body. (Bottom-right)
    -   **Movement Speed:** This will toggle whether you run or walk.
        Walking is slower, but safer, and you won't slip as easily.
        (Left of Body Target)
    -   **Intent:** This selects how you will interact with an object or
        a person when you make an action. (Left of Movement Speed)
        -   (On Intent box: Green is Help (Top-left), Blue is **Disarm**
            (Top-Right), Yellow is **Grab** (Bottom-Right), Red is
            **Harm** (Bottom-Left)).
-   **8. Weapon Mode(Appears above '4' on the HUD image):** When you use
    a ranged weapon, this determines whether you shoot where you click,
    or select targets to take captive. If you activate the latter, you
    may set various conditions for when you will shoot automatically.
    These range from movement to talking on the comms.
-   **9. Status Icons (7):** In the new, lighter UI styles, most of
    these are only visible if something's out-of-the-ordinary.
    -   **Cold Warning**
    -   **Heat Warning:** Appears if the air you're breathing is
        superheated. Usually shows up near fires.
    -   **Toxic Warning:**
    -   **Pressure Warning:** Appears if air pressure is too high or too
        low.
    -   **Oxygen Warning:** Appears if the air you're breathing has too
        little oxygen. If you linger too long, you'll eventually pass
        out and slowly asphyxiate.
    -   **Internals:** Shows whether you are running on internals (an
        oxygen tank and breath mask). If you have them equipped,
        clicking this will switch them on or off.
    -   **Health:** Fades to red as you take more damage. If it flashes
        with the word CRIT, it means you are close to death and require
        immediate medical attention.
    -   **Temperature Warning:** Appears if your surroundings are too
        hot or too cold.
    -   **Hunger:** Appears and gradually fades to red as you get
        hungrier. (It'll take a while to disappear after you eat
        something, though.)

### Interacting With the World

Interacting with your surroundings in Space Station 13 is mostly done by
the mouse. You can click with an empty hand active to pick up items or
open containers, click on something with an item in your active hand to
use the item on it, click on a computer or device to view its display,
and so on. Once you get the hang of managing your character's hands,
things will make more sense: you can't, for example, open a toolbox in
your left hand if your right hand is full.

A good way of interpreting the interaction system in Space Station 13 is
to think of each click as 'using' the object (or hand) on whatever
you're clicking on. For instance, to use a computer in real life, you'd
essentially 'use' an empty hand on it to start typing. Using an empty
hand on an object will pick it up, if you can hold it. Holding an item
in your hand and clicking on something can result in three things:

-   If the object in hand is meant to be used with the object you're
    clicking on, the desired effect should occur. In the case of
    containers, such as drink bottles or beakers, you'll transfer a
    certain amount of units (usually 10) of the liquid from the
    container in your hand, to the container you're clicking on. For
    things like crowbarring the floor, you'll pry off a floor tile.
-   If the object in hand is not meant to be used with the object you're
    clicking on, more often than not (and very annoyingly, sometimes)
    you'll attack the target with the object. This can result in rather
    funny cases of hitting people with first aid kits, hitting your
    drinks machine with a bottle of vodka, etc. Or more dangerously,
    hitting someone with a crowbar, scalpel, toolbox, etc. This happens
    to be the essence of Robusting, as well (which we do not recommend
    you to try on unsuspecting crewmembers for no reason), which is
    basically clicking on someone, but with a weapon or very damaging
    object in hand.
-   If what you're clicking on is something that stores objects, the
    object will be taken out of your hand and placed in or on the
    target. This can be something like a table, opened locker or crate,
    which will place the object on top of the target, such that drinks
    will be placed on tables and jumpsuits will be placed in
    (technically, on) lockers. Objects like boxes and
    backpacks/satchels, which can be opened to reveal more slots for
    storing objects, will remove the item from your hand when clicked
    on, placing it in a slot inside.

It's okay to memorize those, but playing jobs that involve more object
handling, such as Chef, Barman or Cargo Tech, will really help you
understand how the system interprets clicks, and what to expect when
trying to use something.

### Interacting with Other People

Vore Station is, again, a heavily roleplay-focused server, and so your
interactions with those around you are going to be very important. You
won't get very far with pointing-and-clicking alone, so there are
several basic commands to remember when dealing with other characters on
the station:

-   **`Say`:** Speak to those in sight. You can prefix your message with
    a semicolon (`;`) to talk on the general radio channel, if you have
    a headset, or a colon and a letter (i.e. `:m` or `:s`) to talk on
    your department radio channel. (You can examine headsets to see
    which channels they can access.)
-   **`Whisper`:** Speak quietly, only audible to those right next to
    you. Anyone farther away will be told that you're whispering
    something.
-   **`Me`:** Lets you narrate your character's actions in an emote.
    This will have your character's name in front of the text.
    -   A nice tip to remember is that you can still use quotation marks
        with this command like so: **Me "tries to stand up, but falls
        and shouts, "Damnit!"**
-   **`OOC`:** Speak to everyone currently playing, in an
    Out-Of-Character way. This can be used to ask about game mechanics
    and other things not concerning the game. Try not to mention events
    happening in the game in OOC, as everyone can see it.
-   **`LOOC`:** Speak to everyone within your view in an
    Out-Of-Character way. This can be used to ask other players to
    explain procedures or ask for help without having to broadcast your
    request to the entire server.

Don't be afraid to be creative! Writing speech with an accent, or being
descriptive with your emotes, will make you a lot more memorable.

For example:

> **`Say`` ``":n`` ``Dr.`` ``Glass,`` ``could`` ``you`` ``come`` ``to`` ``Xenobiology,`` ``please?`` ``I`` ``think`` ``you`` ``should`` ``see`` ``this...`  
>   
> `Whisper "Don' bloody move, yeah? Or you're a dead man.`  
>   
> `Me "grumbles irritably and kicks his feet up on his desk, glowering at his boss.`**

And don't forget to type properly! Consistently making typos or
forgetting punctuation looks about the same to other players as showing
up to a job interview drunk and slurring.

Here's a quick list of the different radio keys: (NOTE: YOUR HEADSET
MUST HAVE THE CHANNELS TO USE THEM. EXAMINE THE HEADSET TO DETERMINE IF
THEY DO)

-   **:h** Will send your message to your department radio directly.
-   **:c** Will send the message to the Command Channel
-   **:s** Will send the message to the Security Channel
-   **:m** Will send the message to the Medical Channel
-   **:e** Will send the message to the Engineering Channel
-   **:n** Will send the message to the Research Channel
-   **:u** Will send the message to the Supply Channel
-   **:v** Will send the message to the Service Channel
-   **:i** Will let you talk into the neighboring intercom.
-   **:y** will send a message to the Explorers Channel

If you wish to emote something over coms then use " say;! \[...\] ".

What To Do Now
==============

There's a couple of things to do to help you settle in at Vorestation
once you've gotten the hang of the game:

-   **Read up on the guide and lore pages:** You can never know too
    much.

<!-- -->

-   **Make yourself known on the forums:** The server is home to a group
    of players whom make up the BS12 community and we love to see new
    faces, so swing by and [introduce
    yourself!](http://forum.vore-station.net/)

<!-- -->

-   **Try advanced jobs:** Once you feel you have the basics of the game
    under your belt, don't be afraid to check the
    [guides](/wiki/Job_Guides "wikilink") on the other positions available.
    Not only is it more fun, but you might actually get to help the
    station!

<!-- -->
