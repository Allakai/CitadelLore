Hardsuits (also known as Resource Integration Gear, or RIG) are robust and (somewhat) modular pieces of EVA equipment fitted with a plethora of different tools and modules to assist you in your job. Hardsuit functionality can range from boasting high armor and combat-oriented tools to emergency rescue and built-in medical equipment.

= List of RIGs =

== [[File:Evasuit.png|64px]] EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity) ==
A light rig for repairs and maintenance to the outside of habitats and vessels. Located in EVA Equipment. Comes with integrated magboots, maneuvering jets, helmet light, helmet camera, heatsink, and a cover lock. Provides immunity to biohazards and radiation, very strong defense against energy, very small defense against blunt force and explosions, and barely protects against ballistics and lasers.

'''Modules:'''
*Plasma Cutter: Costs five energy per use, capable of cutting through walls.
*Maneuvering Jets: No energy cost, runs off of internal air tank for propulsion. Capable of stabilization.
*Mounted RCD: Variable energy cost based on configuration, basically a Rapid Construction Device in your arm.
*Meson Scanner: No energy cost, integrated meson scanners that are active as long as the helmet is deployed and the module is turned on.

== [[File:Rescuesuit.png|64px]] Rescue Hardsuit ==
A durable suit designed for medical rescue in high risk areas. Located in Medical EMT Bay. Comes with integrated magboots, maneuvering jets, helmet light, helmet camera, heatsink, and a cover lock. It can also be equipped and configured much faster than other hardsuits. Provides immunity to biohazards and radiation, very strong defense against energy, very small defense against blunt force and explosions, and barely protects against ballistics and lasers.

'''Modules:'''
*Maneuvering Jets: No energy cost, runs off of internal air tank for propulsion. Capable of stabilization.
*Sprint System: Costs 50 energy per second as long as it's in use. Noticeably increases running speed.
*PAT System: Highlight of the suit, allows you to open doors (that you have access to) before you reach them, which costs 10 energy per second. It can also override airlocks that you do not have access to in the event the AI doesn't have camera coverage of what you're trying to access, which costs 1000 energy whether the override succeeds or not. Command and Security will be informed over their respective channels should the override succeed.
*Mounted Chem Injector: Syringe mounted on your arm, capable of injecting Inaprovaline, Tricordrazine, Tramadol, or Dexalin Plus into a mob. Costs 50 energy to regenerate medicines as long as regen is enabled.

== [[File:Amisuit.png|64px]] AMI (Anomalous Material Interaction) ==
An Anomalous Material Interaction hardsuit that protects against the strangest energies the universe can throw at it. Located in Anomaly Lab. Comes with integrated magboots, maneuvering jets, helmet light, helmet camera, heatsink, AI suite, and a cover lock.  Provides immunity to biohazards and radiation, very robust defense against energy, strong defense against explosions, moderate defense against lasers and blunt force, and barely protects against ballistics.

'''Modules:'''
*Integrated Intelligence System: A very interesting AI suite that you can hook a pAI into, allowing it to assist you as long as the hardsuit is turned on. Assistance can range from using hardsuit modules to walking you around (perhaps when you're dead). AI Control must be enabled in the Hardsuit Interface in order for this to be useful.
*Maneuvering Jets: No energy cost, runs off of internal air tank for propulsion. Capable of stabilization.
*Alden-Saraspova Counter: No energy cost, exotic particle detector, mostly used to detect anomalies within a radius, providing the range of how far away potential anomalies are from your current position. Small cooldown after each use.
*Mounted Drill: Costs 1 energy per use, mostly drills through rock. Can also drill through walls as long as they aren't reinforced.

== [[File:Advancedsuit.png|64px]] Advanced Voidsuit (CE's Hardsuit) ==
An advanced voidsuit that protects against hazardous, low pressure environments. Located in Chief Engineer's Office. Shines with a high polish. Basically a cooler EVA RIG. Comes with integrated magboots, maneuvering jets, helmet light, helmet camera, heatsink, AI suite, and a cover lock. Provides immunity to biohazards and radiation, small protection against explosions and blunt force, very small protection against lasers and energy, and barely protects against ballistics.

== [[File:Industrialsuit.png|64px]] Industrial Hardsuit ==
A heavy, powerful rig used by construction crews and mining corporations. Located in Mining Equipment. Comes with integrated magboots, maneuvering jets, helmet light, helmet camera, heatsink, and a cover lock. Provides immunity to biohazards, strong defense against blunt force, moderate protection against radiation and ballistics, very small defense against explosions and lasers, and barely protects against energy.

'''Modules:'''
*Plasma Cutter: Costs five energy per use, capable of cutting through walls.
*Mounted Drill: Costs 1 energy per use, mostly drills through rock. Can also drill through walls as long as they aren't reinforced.
*Ore Detector: No energy cost, scans for ore around you. Useful for positioning drill heads.
*Meson Scanner: No energy cost, integrated meson scanners that are active as long as the helmet is deployed and the module is turned on.
*Maneuvering Jets: No energy cost, runs off of internal air tank for propulsion. Capable of stabilization.

= Hardsuit Operation =
Hardsuit control modules are meant to be worn on your back, and it may take some time to put it on. Ensure that you are not wearing anything on the outer clothing or helmet slot. Once equipped, two new tabs will appear in the top-right of your screen with a handful of new verbs, the most important of them being Toggle-Hardsuit in the Hardsuit tab. Details on all verbs can be found below. Once the Toggle-Hardsuit verb is used, the hardsuit will deploy into your outer clothing, gloves, helmet, and shoe slots, and will begin calibrating to your anatomy. If you are already wearing shoes or gloves, then the hardsuit will fit over them automatically. Once calibrated, you will be able to move around freely with some speed penalty. You are able to place your backpack on the suit storage slot as long as the chestpiece is deployed.

== Hardsuit Tab ==
*'''Configure Voice Synthesiser:''' Will allow you to toggle a voice synthesizer on and off, and lets you type in a voice to imitate. Obviously this will do nothing if your hardsuit does not possess the required module
*'''Deploy Hardsuit:''' Deploys all components immediately and simultaneously.
*'''Engage Module:''' Summons a pop-up prompt with a list of modules to activate on your suit. Slow and clunky.
*'''Open Hardsuit Interface:''' Opens a sleek window detailing modules, power supply, and suit permissions.
*'''Select Module:''' Summons a pop-up prompt with a list of modules that will standby until you click. Slow and clunky.
*'''Switch Vision Mode:''' Cycles through vision settings. Only useful if your hardsuit has a configurable visor.
*'''Toggle Boots/Chestpiece/Gauntlets/Helmet:''' Un/Deploys the selected component.
*'''Toggle Hardsuit:''' Turns the suit either on or off. The suit must be fully deployed to perform either of these tasks.
*'''Toggle Module:''' Summons a pop-up prompt with a list of modules that you can toggle on or off. Slow and clunky.
*'''Toggle Visor:''' Self explanatory. Won't work if your suit does not have a configurable visor.

== Hardsuit Modules Tab ==
This is a nice tab to switch to if you don't like the game unfocusing when you select a standalone window/prompt. It will display your suit charge, modules, toggles on said modules, and how much energy it will take to perform actions with these modules. Any cost value ending in '''E''' means that the suit will consume that much energy immediately upon activation, while values ending in '''A''' means the suit will consume that much energy when the module is in use.

= Maintenance =
Hardsuits may need to be recharged or have their internals refilled, primarily the former, or perhaps the hardsuit itself is damaged. To conduct maintenance, do the following:
#Swipe your ID over the control module.
#Crowbar the panel open.
#For internals:
##Wrench the tank out.
#For power cell/control board:
##Screwdriver.
##Select which part you wish to remove.
#Crowbar and ID the control module to lock the suit back up.

To repair the hardsuit, remove the control module and do the following:
*For scorches, use metal.
*For punctures, use a welder.
*For module damage, remove the module and use cable coil or nanopaste.
