Starting off
------------

First, if you're starting from scratch you need to think about a few
things.

-   What kind of character do you want to play?
-   How often do you want to participate in [vore](vore "wikilink")
    activities?

First, you should consider who you want your character to be. An easy
way to start is, what job do you like? If for example, you want to play
an [engineer](engineer "wikilink"), you'd need to make your character
fit into the job at least well enough to do it. If your character is
deadly afraid of poisonous gasses, construction worker is an option. If
your character however, couldn't set up the engine, this would make them
unpopular.

After you've chosen what you want your character to do, you should think
of a few key traits on how they'll act. Is your character confident or
shy? Strong and masculine, or lithe and weak? Do they like to be eaten
or eat people? Or are they afraid of the idea. Perhaps they're
claustrophobic, making them nervous in <s>stomachs</s> maintenance
tunnels, or have a quirks such as a winged character disliking jetpacks
as they're not "real" flying.

Your character is required to be a believable character, who has a
believable life. What is your character a multi-trillionaire who owns
several corporations doing working in a research station full of
[hungry](vore "wikilink") crew members? Stick to someone who has a
reason to work in a job.

Naming characters, and you.
---------------------------

Naming your character is a very important thing. You literally can't
play the game without entering a name. Names (In most cases) are
required to be a first name and a last name, with the optional middle
name.

-   Characters aren't allowed prefixes or nicknames in their names.

<!-- -->

-   Most races are required to have a first and last name.
    [Unathi](/wiki/Unathi "wikilink") are known in some cases to use the
    alternative "verbs-the-noun" naming convention.

<!-- -->

-   Non-human races that aren't listed in the wiki, such as a
    [Tajaran](/wiki/Tajaran "wikilink") being used as a anthropomorphic cat
    are allowed to bypass the two name rule, if it's acceptable in their
    culture. Again, it's recommended to avoid using single names.

This isn't an absolutely concrete rule - essentially, give them an
*actual name* rather than something that'd be more suited to a nickname.
If you've got a single name for your alien critter and nobody minds,
it's unlikely to be enforced. If you're playing a human from Earth and
just walk around being "John" people are going to be asking "John who?"
unless you're doing something like the visitors from *V*.

A little bit of backstory
-------------------------

Now that you have the general base of your character, you can start
working on a backstory. You don't have to make an expansive one for
every day of their life. You can easily make a vague backstory and fill
in the holes as you go. Simply think of a few key points.

-   Where were they born?
-   Did they have a nice childhood, or a rough one?
-   What did they do before working for NanoTrasen?
-   Is Virgo station their first NanoTrasen workplace?
-   How did they wind up getting assigned to Virgo station?
-   How educated are they?
-   Is there anything they'd rather not talk about?

Most of these bits are simple enough to easily memorize, and will help
you think of something to answer when in a conversation in game. They
will also be handy when filling out your character records, particularly
your employment records.

Do note that your character's backstory should be believable -
villainous characters and organizations in their past, if any, should
have motivations beyond "just because it's evil", or "because I have an
OOC fetish for this". Multi-stellar corporations and planetary
governments don't go polluting backwater worlds for the sheer sake of
polluting them outside of Saturday morning cartoons, and it's a rare
criminal that commits criminal acts *because* they're against the law.
Likewise, try to avoid some of the Mary Sue warning signs - just
googling for the phrase "Mary Sue" will bring up a whole laundry list of
resources for you here.

**Furthermore, check with an admin (the guys that play CentCom) before
introducing a character with a backstory along the lines of "NanoTrasen
did X" or "CentCom did Y" if it's something that falls outside what they
would normally do, especially if it's something that would be so morally
bankrupt that other characters would quit their jobs if they found
out.** "NT bought out the company where my father worked, stripped its
assets and reassigned or laid off all the staff" is probably fine, it's
within the realms of things that actual companies do if they can get
away with it, while "The NanoTrasen Navy landed on our planet and
abducted the population at gunpoint to sanguinary them for medical
bloodbag supplies like that bit out of Blade 3" is stretching it a tad
far.

**Likewise, a backstory tie-in with an existing character should not be
done without OOC permission from that character's player.** They may
have backstory elements in mind that haven't been revealed yet, or may
well be planning on introducing one of their backstory characters as an
actual on-station character, and may not take kindly to you hijacking
them or forcing something they don't want into their canon. In short -
if a character or organization has been created or is played by anyone
other than yourself, seek permission from the person or people that play
them before dictating their actions.

Give them a set of skills
-------------------------

![An example of typical skill levels for a [Head of
Security](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink").](CharacterSkills.png "An example of typical skill levels for a Head of Security.")

The Skill System is a new way of detailing out your characters
abilities. These are optional and purely for reference purposes. They do
not have any effect in-game. **Repeat, they have no in-game effects**.
While we don't really enforce this to Baystation's levels (and probably
never will), the system is there as a handy guide to help players to
create realistically skilled characters, and to know when they're
starting to stretch the point of being overpowered.

Based on your backstory, you should have a set of skills chosen for your
character that make sense, but also aren't overpowered. You can use the
"Skills" tab in the character creation for deciding what knowledge your
character should possess. These choices do *not* affect any in-game
interactions on Vorestation, but rather, they exist as a tool to help
guide a player into creating a believable character.

You should avoid characters who know too many skills, as they are
considered not believable, and even potentially powergaming which
explicitly violates the [server's
rules](/wiki/Rules#Do_not_powergame "wikilink"). Characters who have a higher
age are granted more skill points, but obviously a man in his 70's
shouldn't be moving heavy gear or chasing bad guys with a stun baton, so
be reasonable about how old or how young your character is.

-   Characters who are new to the server should *try* to stay around
    "Average" or less based on a skill set. "Above Average" is *okay* if
    your character only specializes in one particular job (such as a
    Head of Staff).
-   Characters who have been present on the station for *at least* a
    month are safer to have an "Above Average" skill set, because they
    have probably picked up a few new skills while working.
-   Characters who have been present on the station for *multiple
    real-life years* can have a skill set up to "Exceptional" without
    many complaints from people. A year is a very long time. Chances are
    you know at least the very basics of most departments, or have been
    trained by other staff to do different jobs.
-   Characters who have a skill level of "Genius" are generally not okay
    without a special character application, or for an event.
-   Characters who have a skill level of "God" are probably bullshit and
    therefore not allowed by the [server
    rules](/wiki/Rules#Do_not_powergame "wikilink").

Give them a description
-----------------------

You'll want to give your character some flavor text! Expect an admin to
poke you if you show up too many times without setting it, because it's
unusual for players to have no flavor text, and is usually the sign of a
griefer or bad roleplayer. You may also find yourself having trouble
finding scenes without it, as your fellow players will have no idea what
they are dealing with when they look at you.

Your flavor text should be a brief *physical* description of your
character - what they look like, what physical mannerisms they may have,
if applicable, that sort of thing. Basically, whatever information would
be available at a glance. Picture references are fine, as are links to
RP profiles and the like, such as your chat profile. Try to include any
links *first* and ensure that the URL is under 28 characters, so people
examining you will be able to click the link without having to expand
your full profile and copy-paste. We recommend
[Imgur.com](http://imgur.com) for pictures. The links are short enough
to be correctly parsed, and nobody is afraid of clicking an Imgur link.

Your OOC Metainfo/OOC Notes should include a brief summary of any RP
prefs you may have, particularly any types of scenes you absolutely
won't do. See the [Guide to Vore](/wiki/Guide_to_Vore#OOC_Notes "wikilink")
for more information.

You don't have to write an essay, just a quick summary will do - for
example, the following is the flavor text for Father Heath Wintergreen,
a chaplain who occasionally serves on board the station:

> An old, sandy-yellow furred rabbit who's turning white around the
> edges, his movements slow and deliberate. He's clearly past his prime,
> but still has that glint in his eyes that shows there's plenty of life
> in this old bun yet.

Remember that you can "set pose" in-game using the IC tab. Normally this
tells certain verbs or adverbs describing your character's current
status, such as that they are currently covered in stomach juices after
a recent escape, but it can also be used as a makeshift OOC Note message
to say things like you're okay with being eaten even though you're AFK.

**Do not** add things like their personality or their backstory. That
stuff belongs in their employment/security/medical records.

Give them a file
----------------

Your character's records are broken down into three sections -
employment, medical and security. These are a great place to put the
backstory elements and fluff text for your characters that people
wouldn't know simply from looking at them. All heads of staff have
access to the employment records, and medical and security staff have
access to their respective records as well - if your character has
troublemaking tendencies, for instance, it's likely to be something that
would be noted in their security records.

Though the character limit is far more generous than it is for flavor
text, you are in no way obliged to try and fill it. As an example,
here's the employment record for the example character mentioned above:

> Prior to his medical discharge, Father Wintergreen served as a
> chaplain in the NanoTrasen navy for 28 years.
>
> Note that despite his naval background, he has no formal combat
> training and should not be deputized for active security duty. His
> experience and pre-service qualifications concerning Space Law and
> standard operating procedure may allow him to stand in as an advocate
> should no other crew be available.

And that's it. It establishes that he used to be in the navy, has had a
long career as a chaplain and is likely nearing retirement, and that he
was discharged from his post for medical reasons - all of which are
conversation starters should anyone want to look him up and have a chat.

But I want a snowflake!
-----------------------

In Vorestation, you're sharing a map with around <s>20</s> <s>35</s> up
to 50 players. Making a character to be above other players isn't going
to make a popular character. In short, no *one* person can be [the main
character](/wiki/The_Hero_the_Station_Needs "wikilink").

However, due to the nature of the server, our characters all are going
to stick out a little bit. A good rule of thumb is, don't try to make
the game all about yourself. That's not to say that an unusual character
can't be interesting if they're well thought out - just take care to
avoid straying into Mary Sue territory, and if you're unsure, or have an
idea for an odd character but aren't quite sure how to make them fit
well into the setting, hop onto the chat or grab one of the admins!
There have been times when a character concept really didn't seem like
it would work at first, but after bouncing it back and forth a few times
was developed into something far more interesting than what would have
happened had the player just dumped them onto the station.

If you still want to play a character that wouldn't normally be
permitted, you can make a [Special Character
Application](whitelist "wikilink") on the forums.

-   A character who is 21 years old is likely to have just gotten out of
    medical school. In no way is it recommended to have them be a head
    of staff, as they have little to no experience in the job. This
    applies to most jobs, including captain. Characters with ten years
    (Not real life!) experience are better suited for the job.

<!-- -->

-   Ex-military characters should be avoided unless you're personally
    knowledgeable in military life, or are actually a veteran in real
    life. Otherwise you'll just look stupid, especially to people who
    actually know it well enough to know you're full of lies. If your
    character *does* have a military background, they're better off
    being fairly low-ranking.
-   No, really, military characters are nearly *always* done badly.
    Especially experimental combat androids, genetically engineered
    supersoldiers, lab-grown assassins, navy seals with over 300
    confirmed kills, any of that edgy bullshit. Expect a great deal of
    cynicism if you make a character like this - not least of which,
    people asking awkward questions like "why is your black ops assassin
    talking about their time as a black ops assassin?" and "why the fuck
    is this experimental megatrooper serving on a glorified gas station
    as a junior officer" and "how come this ultimate badass just got
    pecked to death by an angry goose". See also
    [Rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink").

<!-- -->

-   Characters who are <s>insane</s> <s>homicidal</s> incapable of
    comprehending reality generally aren't going to be working on a
    highly expensive research station. See also
    [Rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink").

<!-- -->

-   Suicidal characters aren't fun for anyone. Most of the time, they
    are used for attention grabbing. It's also bannable. ...See also
    [Rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink").

<!-- -->

-   A character capable of mastering engineering, medical and being a
    lawyer at age 17 isn't going to work on this station. They would be
    somewhere where they are making better money. They aren't going
    here. SEE ALSO [Rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink").

<!-- -->

-   Even if you're playing a nonhuman, genetically modified, augmented,
    or otherwise physically unusual character, steer clear of giving
    them special abilities that can't be easily replicated in-game. A
    little fluff-ability for *private* scenes is fine, such as a naga
    with a venomous bite to subdue prey, but anything that would
    actually involve a tangible in-game advantage is probably a little
    too far.

<!-- -->

-   Characters that *are* unusual, like a soul-voring succubus or
    something, are best to keep their abilities under wraps in public.
    See [Souls](Souls "wikilink") and the [Rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink").

<!-- -->

-   **If someone *does* spout lore-questionable stuff (or things from
    other server lore that aren't generally publicly known, like talking
    about changelings, or that aren't applicable here) ICly over the
    radio or in a loud public conversation, your character is perfectly
    at liberty to be skeptical. Just because another character says it
    doesn't make it canon gospel truth.**

Playing a confrontational character
-----------------------------------

Obviously not every character on the station is going to be a perfect
cooperative angel. We're telling a story here, and sometimes a little
conflict is needed to drive the story along, even if that conflict is
merely someone having different priorities when it comes to how their
time and resources should be spent, or one character having information
that another character does not. Sometimes characters will have goals,
personalities and drives that run into complete opposition to the rest
of the crew.

Played well, these characters can lead to some thrilling RP. Played
badly, they are a massive headache that nobody can stand to share a
server with. Please be mentally prepared if an admin asks you to create
another character, or to change your existing one because you are the
only one having fun playing with them.

### The Golden Rule

Before you even start, the most important factor to consider is this:
this is a game. Primarily played for fun. You're here to have fun, the
other players are here to have fun. If other players are unable to have
fun around you, then... you can take it as a sign that you're kinda just
being a dick.

This applies to all characters, not just the "villains". Crooked,
hardass cops, criminals, overbearing bosses, rowdy assistants, crazy
"psycho" pack-alphas, anyone who goes out of their way to impose
themselves upon other players, all these characters should be played
with one simple question in mind - "am I playing a character that's fun
to play *with?*"

Ask yourself, as a *player* - OOCly, what do you think you're adding to
the game? What are you as a player getting out of this? What do you
think the other players are getting out of it?

### Pitfalls to be wary of

By far the largest pitfall of playing an aggressive, argumentative, or
merely petty criminal character is to make one that's *so* aggressive,
*so* over the top, that nobody in their right mind could ever be
seriously expected to willingly interact with them, certainly not hire
them. If you're a criminal, have more to your personality than "being a
criminal". Bring something else to the table.

Say you're a security officer - you've heard another character is a bit
shifty and want to be a hardass cop, so you spend your shift following
them around, harassing them, watching them, looking for excuses to bust
them, then on the tiniest *hint* of anything that you can use as an
excuse to drag them into a cell, you order their arrest and force them
to flee into maintenance where you conduct a 30-minute manhunt over a
crime that's worth a 2-minute cell timer. After all that, the other
player is pissed off that some asshole has been harrassing them all
shift over basically nothing and has been unable to enjoy themselves. Do
you think they *like* having someone impose their validboner on them?

On the flip side - maybe you want to make a petty criminal character.
You might justify this to yourself as "giving security something to do"
- the problem is, are you as a player sure they *want* to be given
something to do whether they want it or not? Chasing down the same
asshole shift after shift, or seeing a particular name on the manifest
and muttering to yourself "screw playing security today if they're on
board", is a joke that can get old fast.

Perhaps you want to make a character who's just a little aggressive and
unhinged. Picks barfights, threatens people with knives, screams threats
over comms constantly - meanwhile, the player who's character you're
screaming at just came home from a hard shift at work and just wants to
come on and unwind in the bar and find someone to chat and cuddle with,
and now they've got this edgelord *asshole* getting up in their face and
ruining the mood whether they want it or not.

Sure, your knife-fetishist stabsona might get OOC compliments for your
wonderful descriptive bladeplay in the dorm with a fellow
slicing-enthusiast that shares your kinks, but the moment you walk up to
a nurse and start threatening to gut them like a fish, the ahelps start
flying. What gives?

### The deepest secret lore

You might have noticed a common factor in the above examples - and it's
a simple failure of the player to ask themselves "is the other player up
for dealing with my shit today?"

That's really all there is to it. "This is fun for me, but is it fun for
them?"

Keep this question in mind when you play, and you'll be alright.
