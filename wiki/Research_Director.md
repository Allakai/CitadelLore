The [Research Director](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink") in charge of what
is (theoretically) [the reason the station is
around](/wiki/Backstory "wikilink"). You job is to direct research into new
things. And you have a group of [Scientists](/wiki/Scientist "wikilink") to
help you do that.

Overview
--------

Unlike most Heads of Staff, your job isn't so much to keep [your
staff](/wiki/Job_Guides#Medical_and_Science "wikilink") working as it is to
*keep* them from doing so. Or, at least, to keep them from doing so
*badly*.

Technically speaking, your job is the least vital out of any of the
Heads of Staff. The Science division isn't vital to the continued
operations of the [Virgo Orbital Research
Establishment](/wiki/Virgo_Orbital_Research_Establishment "wikilink"), even if
it is why it's there in the first place. The station won't fall apart if
the slimes die, alien artefacts never get studied, and bombs never get
made. It *will*, however, fall apart if the slimes *escape*, if
dangerous alien artefacts aren't well-monitored, or if a poorly-made
bomb destroys the Escape arm.

Your job, then is to keep them from accidentally killing themselves.
[Toxins Mixing](/wiki/Guide_to_Toxins "wikilink") and
[Xenobiology](/wiki/Xenobiology "wikilink") in particular are highly-dangerous
areas, and should be monitored at all times.

You're also the foremost expert on strange phenomena on the station.
When [something strange](/wiki/Xenomorph "wikilink") shows up, it's your job
to figure out what it is and how best to deal with it. The other Heads
of Staff will rely on you to figure out exactly what it is and what to
do about it.

So, in short, keep your staff from screwing everything up royally and
keep the other Heads informed about anything weird going on.

You arrive on the station inside your office next to toxins. You have
the front seat. So sit back and enjoy the view. Remember that you have
two of the most important things on the station, Robotics control and
the AI integrity restorer.

Directing Research 101
----------------------

As the Research Director, your job is obviously to direct research. You
have access to anything scientific.

### There's No I In Team

Your official responsibility is to ensure that nobody does anything they
shouldn't. This means making sure the
[Geneticists](/wiki/Geneticist "wikilink") don’t run rampant with powers, that
[Roboticists](/wiki/Roboticist "wikilink") don’t cyborg people without good
reason, and that Toxins does not destroy the station.

Try to stop Toxins from igniting. Teach your scientists the proper way
to handle [phoron](phoron "wikilink").

### Computer Maintenance And You

In the event of AI damage on an Intelicard, there is a computer in your
office which can be used to repair its systems. This is a long process,
but it is still usually better than having no AI at all. In addition, it
is possible to build a new AI from the circuit also found in your
office. Using plasteel and glass, it is constructed just like any other
computer up until the human brain is inserted. Keep the existence of the
human component hush-hush! It's a [trade
secret](/wiki/Backstory#Nanotrasen "wikilink")! Please be aware that a freshly
constructed [AI](/wiki/AI "wikilink") comes with the default NanoTrasen laws.

### AI Overpopulation: The Core Circuit And You

Whether to reduce the load on primary AI or just to increase information
chaos, with this nifty AI Core circuit board found in your office you
can make a second, working AI. You need the following components first:
a screwdriver, a wrench, 4 sheets of plasteel, 2 sheets of reinforced
glass, the circuit board, and, of course, a brain in an MMI.

Make AI Core frame with plasteel, wrench it in a preferably secure place
near an [intercom](/wiki/Intercom "wikilink") (or a radio), add circuit,
screwdriver, wires, MMI, glass, screwdrive again. Voila! Now there's two
working AIs on station!

### Assistant with Science

You can be of great help as an assistant with large amounts of access.
Collecting flashes and power cells for robotics and other items for
research.

### Upgrading the station

NT has granted your colleagues a station that has plenty of room for
improvement. Plenty of machines around the station can be upgraded to
improve efficiency, and you're encouraged to let your coworkers feel
what an efficient science really means: Better work conditions. Use the
![](RPED.png "fig:RPED.png") Rapid Part Exchanger device, produced by
the [Protolathe](/wiki/Protolathe "wikilink") to rapidly replace obsolete
parts with newers parts; or deconstruct and reconstruct the machine from
the getgo. Use the [Guide to Advanced
Construction](/wiki/Guide_to_Advanced_Construction "wikilink") to check what
parts each machine contains, to know what stock parts to replace. The
RPED is also able to scan the stock parts present in the machine. Below
is the list of currently upgradeable machines:

-   Biogenerator. Upgrades improve recycling and lowers costs.
-   Borg Charger. Upgrades speed charging and enables repairs.
-   Protolathe. Upgrades cut production costs; up to half.
-   Circuit Imprinter. Upgrades cut productions costs; up to half.
-   Autolathe. Upgrades lower material loss in production, down to 0%.
-   Destructive Analyzer. Upgrades increase minimum reliability that can
    be analyzed.
-   Cloning Pod. Upgrades increase clone health; with the highest level
    removing the need for cryo.
-   PACMANS. Upgrades decrease heat emitted and power produced per
    sheet.
-   Gas heater/coolers. Upgrades increase efficiency and cooling range.

### Lamar

Inside the display case in your office is a surgically modified
[facehugger](xenos "wikilink"). It can no longer kill and implant its
embryos inside a host body, but it still feels the need to leap on
anyone in reach. It's usually best kept in its case. Some [crew
members](/wiki/Succubus "wikilink") may want to break into your office for
Lamarr. They're weird.

Links to Other Departments
--------------------------

As the research director, you are the link between the captain, the
heads of staff, and your researchers. R&D supplies technology to the
other departments and receives supplies from the miners and
quartermaster. When something strange happens--someone [turns into a
monkey](changeling "wikilink"), [teleports without a
device](wizard "wikilink"), or has [illegal
technology](traitor "wikilink")--it's your job to try to explain what
just happened. Good luck.

Predding
--------

While you're less threatening than the [apex
predator](head_of_Security "wikilink"), you do have a lot of cool toys
to play with. You can easily get stun gloves ('Roleplay is not
optional'), make stun guns and you have access to a [personal lunch
fetcher](telescience "wikilink").
