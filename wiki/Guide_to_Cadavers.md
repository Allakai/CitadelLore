What to Do with a Dead Body
---------------------------

First and foremost, if you find a dead body, report it to security and
to medical. Try not to report it over the main radio if possible. If the
person is cloned, they will suffer from [ clone memory
disorder](/wiki/Geneticist#Clone_Memory_Disorder "wikilink"). This will affect
their ability to remember how they died. After they are cloned, however,
do tell them that they have died.

Security will often want to do an [
inspection](/wiki/Guide_to_security#Collecting_Evidence "wikilink") of the
area where the body was found. Medical personal should not move the body
unless they get clearance from security first. <b>Do not drag the body
on its own to Medbay.</b> Use a body bag or roller bed. Dead bodies tend
to splatter blood everywhere, making for unhappy janitors. Using a
roller bed is often times better if you have to go down the main halls.
Most staff members will assume you are transporting an injured
individual and this will lead to less questions.

<b>Remember that dead people are players too.</b> Try not to dawdle to
much, and get them either cloned or borged as fast as possible.

Body bags and morgue trays can be easily labeled with a pen. An
organized morgue is a happy morgue is a morgue that security doesn't ask
many questions about. After bodies have been categorized and cloned, you
might want to talk to the [chaplain](chaplain "wikilink") about having
the body cremated if the morgue is getting a little full.

Resurrection
------------

There are several ways to resurrect a dead body. Again, remember that
dead people are players too. Be nice to fellow players and try to get
them back in the game as soon as you can.

### Cloning

A [geneticist](geneticist "wikilink") can easily clone a body. If no
geneticist is available, contact either the [Chief Medical
Officer](/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer "wikilink") or the [Research
Director](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink") for assistance.

### Cyborgification

A [roboticist](roboticist "wikilink") will deal with [
cyborgification](/wiki/Guide_to_robotics#Cyborgs "wikilink"), making the
player of the cadaver a [cyborg](cyborg "wikilink"). This is normally a
last resort issue if there is no way to clone a body. Either a [
surgeon](/wiki/Doctor "wikilink") or [roboticist](roboticist "wikilink") can
remove the brain and place it within a MMI. Contact the [Research
Director](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink") if no roboticist is available
for the procedure.

### Growing a New Body

A [botanist](botanist "wikilink") can [ grow a new
body](/wiki/Guide_to_Hydroponics#Invasion_of_the_Pod_People "wikilink") in
hydroponics. The nifty thing about this is that it only requires a
syringe filled with blood of the deceased.

Autopsy Procedures
------------------

Luckily, within the morgue there is a handy dandy operating table for
use in autopsies. Surgeons and sometimes Forensic Technicians will
normally be the ones to use this table.

### Autopsy Surgery

1.  Place cadaver onto the operating table.
2.  Scan the cadaver with a Health Analyer to find injured locations.
3.  Aim for the patient's affected area in the
    ![](Damage_zone.png "fig:Damage_zone.png") Damage Zone.
4.  Cut the skin with your ![](Scalpel.png "fig:Scalpel.png") scalpel
    (the chest may require two cuts).
5.  Use the ![](Autopsy_scanner.png "fig:Autopsy_scanner.png") autopsy
    scanner to scan the area.
6.  Repeat for all affected areas.

### Autopsy Reports

Right clicking on the Autopsy Scanner will let you print out an autopsy
report. Go over it to make sure there isn't information missing.
<b>Hint:</b> There will be information missing. It's a good idea to take
out a pen and write down some additional details.

-   What the final vital stats were at time of death. (Suffocation,
    Toxins, Brute, and Burn.)
-   What cause of death is if not listed on autopsy report.
-   Who brought in the cadaver.
-   If the body was cloned or borged, and who the geneticist or
    roboticist was that did that.
-   Who the person was that preformed the autopsy itself.
-   Your signature.

Remember, this is a chance to be creative with what you write. Don't be
afraid to go overboard with details and descriptions.

<i><small>Urist McCadaver was brought in by Urist McEMT. They were
cloned by Uristina McGeneticist upon arrival. As listed above, victim
was hit several times with a toolbox and then stabbed with a
screwdriver. Injuries from these weapons were not severe enough to cause
death, and since suffocation damage was listed at 127, it is probably
safe to assume that they were strangled. Blood count was at 83%, which
supports the theory that they died before they could bleed out. The
autopsy was preformed by Urist McSurgeon, and autopsy report handled by
Urist McNurse.</small></i>

<i><small>Urist McCadaver died within patient room two and was
discovered by Urist McOrderly. Cloning could not be completed due to
inactive brain activity. Autopsy is being preformed by myself, Dr. Urist
McSurgeon. An oral examination of the cadaver shows that their tongue
was bitten off, and examination of their stomach contents shows where
that tongue ended up. Lungs were filled with the cadaver's blood. In
short, they bit off their own tongue, swallowed it, and then proceeded
to drown in their own blood. Suffocation damage will support this
theory, so I'm just going to rule it as a suicide and call it a day.  
Signed,  
Dr. Urist McSurgeon </small></i>

After completing your notes, make a copy of the report, file one in the
morgue's autopsy reports cabinet, and deliver the other to security.
Preferably with the [detective](detective "wikilink").

### Causes of Death

Oftentimes cause of death is not clear from the autopsy report. These
require a little more digging and investigation to find out the truth,
and experience as a [Medical Doctor](/wiki/Medical_Doctor "wikilink") will
help out greatly.

#### Decapitation

The cadaver has had its head removed before other injuries could cause
death.

-   Health scans reveal damages on the cadaver do not add up to 200 or
    over.
-   There is no head.

#### De-Braining

The cadaver has had its brain removed while they were still alive.

-   Visual examination states that they have no brain.
-   Skull has already been cut into during an autopsy attempt.

#### Burst Appendix

The appendix has burst within the body, causes sepsis and eventually
death. Often by chocking on one's own vomit.

-   Toxin damage with no toxins showing up in system.
-   Minor brute damage to the groin region.
-   Heavy suffocation damage.
-   Body was located buried in vomit.

#### Suicide

The cadaver had bitten off their own tongue, overflow of blood would
have entered their lungs, causing drowning in their own fluids.

-   Visual examination states that the individual has killed themselves.
-   Severe suffocation damage.

#### Bleeding Out

The cadaver had gone into shock and passed away due to heavy blood loss
from either internal or external wounds.

-   Body appears pale.
-   A Health Analyzer scan shows that their blood has fallen to
    dangerously low levels.
-   Suffocation damage.
-   Placing the body within the Body Scanner will show locations of
    internal bleeders.

#### Malpractice

Anything resulting in death caused by a doctor attempting to treat the
patient is considered to be malpractice. Some of these are not great
enough to cause death on it's own, but can play in as contributing
factors.

##### Surgery Mishaps

Mistakes caused by a surgeon. Any tool mishaps will show up on the
autopsy report, however preforming surgery in an non-sterile environment
will cause the surgery location to become infected with sepsis.

-   Visible inflamed wounds.
-   Infection shows up on a Health Analyzer Scan.
-   Cadaver had undergone surgery before death.

##### Blood Rejection

Individual was given an incompatible blood type that their body
proceeded to reject.

-   Toxin damage with no clear source.
-   Suffocation with no clear source.
-   Cadaver had received a blood transfusion before death.

##### Improper Transport

Individual was not transported properly during medical treatment, which
resulted in further injury.

-   Does not show up on any scans.
-   Best indicator is large trails of blood where the cadaver had
    previously been.

##### Medication Overdose

Someone had given the patient to much of a healing medication, which
resulted in overdose.

-   Heavy toxin damage.
-   Toxin report shows no harmful chemicals in the system.
-   Using an Advanced Mass Spectrometer will show amounts of chemicals
    in the blood stream.

Being Dead
==========

Sometimes, you have no choice but to stay dead and fly around as a
[ghost](ghost "wikilink"). Using the ghost verb will allow you to ghost
out of your dead body and have a look around the station, but there are
a few things to be wary of:

-   Not being in your body can prevent you from being resurrected.
-   Ghosting out of a brain or decapitated head might prevent you from
    re-entering your body.
-   Opting to become a [pAI](pAI "wikilink") or
    [Mouse](/wiki/Mouse "wikilink") will remove any chance of you being able
    to be resurrected.
-   <b>Never</b> use knowledge gained during your time in death in life.
    Clones suffer from [ clone memory
    disorder](/wiki/Geneticist#Clone_Memory_Disorder "wikilink").
