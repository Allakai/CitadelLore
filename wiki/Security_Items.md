Items
-----

### <img src="PFlash.gif" title="fig:PFlash.gif" alt="PFlash.gif" width="64" />Portable Flash

A portable flasher is an effective device that when secured to the
ground, will automatically emit a bright light, stunning anyone who runs
past and is not wearing a form of protection against bright lights. To
prepare a portable flasher, first bring it to the desired area, then use
a wrench to secure the bolts to the ground. Once you have done that, the
portable flasher will draw power from the local APC. A secured portable
flasher will emit a bright flash when it's motion sensors detect someone
moving past at running speeds. If you are not wearing a form of bright
light eye protection (such as sunglasses or a welding helmet) you will
become momentarily stunned if you are close to the portable flasher when
it goes off.

### <img src="Deployable_Barrier.gif" title="fig:Deployable_Barrier.gif" alt="Deployable_Barrier.gif" width="64" />Deployable Barrier

A deployable barrier that can be used to block an entrance or as a
barricade against armed forces during red alerts.

### <img src="Recharger.gif" title="fig:Recharger.gif" alt="Recharger.gif" width="64" />Recharger

A conventional energy device recharger is a useful device which can
recharge any energy based device should it run out of power. As a member
of security you will most likely be using these to recharge your energy
guns and tasers. The recharge time of your energy based devices will
vary depending on their maximum capacity.

### <img src="Implantbox.png" title="fig:Implantbox.png" alt="Implantbox.png" width="64" />Tracking Implant

Box full of tracking utensils.

### <img src="Implantbox.png" title="fig:Implantbox.png" alt="Implantbox.png" width="64" />Chemical Implant

Box of stuff used to implant chemicals.

### <img src="Handcuffsbox.png" title="fig:Handcuffsbox.png" alt="Handcuffsbox.png" width="64" /><img src="Handcuffs.png" title="fig:Handcuffs.png" alt="Handcuffs.png" width="50" />Handcuffs

Throw a pair in your pocket, more can be dispensed from the SecTech. It
prevents doors from opening, items being held, and escape if the
[person](crew "wikilink") being restrained is being pulled. A restraint
for the hands, in order to restrain a suspect simply pull him while he
is handcuffed. Be careful not to bump into anybody else! It may loosen
the prisoner from your grip, allowing him to run free.

To handcuff a perp, you must grab the suspect in an aggressive grab
before being able to cuff him/her. Do so by setting to grab intent and
grabbing him with an empty hand.

A [freedom implant](/wiki/Syndicate_Items#Freedom_Implant "wikilink") can
remove them instantly, but everyone else has to struggle with them for
two or more minutes in a private area to get them off without outside
help. Can be combined with orange prison [shoes](shoes "wikilink") to
make foot shackles, which force a person to always walk.

Keep in mind a prisoner is capable of removing handcuffs in roughly two
minutes. If you see them attempt this and they are not yet secured in
the brig it is standard protocol to use a hand-held flash to briefly
incapacitate them. Simply warn them that this is resisting arrest. Only
if they attempt to remove the handcuffs a second time should you
penalize them for it.

### <img src="SpaceLaw.png" title="fig:SpaceLaw.png" alt="SpaceLaw.png" width="64" /> Corporate Regulations

An official copy of [Corporate
Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") is made available to all
security personnel. Ensure that you understand it and don't be afraid to
literally throw the book at anyone who contests it.

### <img src="Flash.gif" title="fig:Flash.gif" alt="Flash.gif" width="64" />Flash

A versatile tool! Flashes are a small device capable of producing an
extremely bright light, that is capable of blinding someone for
approximately one second if they are immediately adjacent to you. This
light will overcome visual senses, causing disorientation while the
brain tries to process or block the sudden input overload and fleeting
pain or discomfort. If you target them specifically with the flash you
will not only blind them, but knock them down with enough time to
handcuff them. This is an acceptable alternative to a [stun
baton](stun_baton "wikilink") in a pinch. However, it will not work
against anybody wearing protective eye coverings such as [Welding
Helmets](/wiki/Welding_Helmets "wikilink") or
[Sunglasses](/wiki/Sunglasses "wikilink") (note: this does not apply to
[Borgs](/wiki/Borgs "wikilink"), strangely. Overexposure can cause blindness,
and the flash's bulb is prone to burning out. Despite having Flashes
implanted as occular devices, hand held flashes can be used to stun a
rogue [cyborg](cyborg "wikilink")). Carry it in your pocket. Distributed
by SecTech vendors.

Some [revolutionary](/wiki/Game_Modes#Revolution "wikilink") leaders can use
flashes to brainwash other members of the crew if they are not wearing
protective gear.

### <img src="Pepperspray.png" title="fig:Pepperspray.png" alt="Pepperspray.png" width="64" />Pepperspray

Just a pepperspray, used to temporarily blind a criminal. Best used
instead of a stun baton when your opponent doesn't have any eye
protection, because unlike a stun baton, even if they disarm you, they
can't use it against you as long as you're wearing your own Security HUD
glasses. Aim for the eyes.

### <img src="Hailer.png" title="fig:Hailer.png" alt="Hailer.png" width="64" />Hailer

Device used to tell people to stop, without having to shout it yourself.

### <img src="RiotS.png" title="fig:RiotS.png" alt="RiotS.png" width="64" /><img src="Metal_Riot_Shield.png" title="fig:Metal_Riot_Shield.png" alt="Metal_Riot_Shield.png" width="64" />Riot Shield

Protects against melee attack from the direction you're facing. Also
makes a decent melee weapon.

### <img src="Scanner.png" title="fig:Scanner.png" alt="Scanner.png" width="64" />Forensic Scanner

Used for identifying blood and finger prints on any object. Wearing
[gloves](gloves "wikilink") prevents finger prints being left behind. It
has two modes, one in which it just scans and another where it will
print out a card outlining the results of that scan as well. The
[detective](detective "wikilink") starts with one of these and has a
spare in his locker.

### <img src="Tape_Recorder.gif" title="fig:Tape_Recorder.gif" alt="Tape_Recorder.gif" width="64" />Tape Recorder

When activated, it records all spoken conversations around a specific
area. It is able to print out transcripts of the recordings on-demand.
It spawns in various locations around the station, including (but not
limited to) the [Library](/wiki/Library "wikilink") and
[Brig](/wiki/Brig "wikilink").

### <img src="Box.png" title="fig:Box.png" alt="Box.png" width="64" /> <img src="Evidence_Bag.png" title="fig:Evidence_Bag.png" alt="Evidence_Bag.png" width="64" />Evidence Bag

Bags used to hold criminal evidence preserving the DNA and fingerprints
on it.

Weapons
-------

### <img src="StunBaton.gif" title="fig:StunBaton.gif" alt="StunBaton.gif" width="64" />Stun Baton

Security's bread and butter. Stun batons have two modes: on and off.
While on, the baton delivers 'HALLOSS' damage, and the first hit will
cause the target to slow down, while the second hit will cause him to
lose consciousness, similar to taser hits.

To recharge a stun baton, take out its battery using a screwdriver, and
recharge it at a cell recharger, before sticking the battery back into
the baton.

**`Note:`**`Stunning someone on harm intent will cause him/her to bleed, giving him brute damage. Be a professional officer and do not use the baton on harm intent.`

### <img src="Telebaton.png" title="fig:Telebaton.png" alt="Telebaton.png" width="64" />Telescopic Baton

A baton used by the head of security and the Captain. Extremely harmful.
Not to be used if you still want the suspect to be able to talk.

### <img src="Tasernew.png" title="fig:Tasernew.png" alt="Tasernew.png" width="64" />Taser

This is a ranged alternative to the [stun baton](stun_baton "wikilink"),
however it only has five charges. Maintain both this at a [recharger
port](recharger_port "wikilink").

Like the baton, you should wear this on your belt and carry the other in
your backpack. The taser fires an incandescent ball of energy at low
velocity, the projectile is stopped by windows, grills, walls, and
various other obstructions. These bolts cause temporary paralysis
because of the convulsions and speech will be painfully slurred.

Clicking on someone adjacent to you on any non-harm intent will cause
you to stun them much like a [stun baton](stun_baton "wikilink"), except
for a much longer time.

Melee use of this weapon is inappropriate except for the most extreme
cases [(see Corporate Regulations section Dangerous
Criminals)](/wiki/Space_law#Major_Crimes "wikilink"). When aiming for the
head, tazers are exceptional melee weapons even when out of charge, very
often knocking the opponent unconscious with a single blow.

### ![](egun.gif "fig:egun.gif")Energy Gun

Distributed by the [Warden](/wiki/Warden "wikilink"). The combination of a
[tazer](tazer "wikilink") and a [laser gun](laser_gun "wikilink"), just
click to alternate between a killing laser and a stunning tazer; they
default to stun. More shots will be fired if exclusively used in kill
mode than exclusively used in stun mode before its energy is depleted,
but it can be recharged. Like tasers, energy guns make exceptional melee
weapons due to their uncanny ability to knock people unconscious when
aimed for the head. The [Captain](/wiki/Captain "wikilink"), [head of
Personnel](head_of_Personnel "wikilink"), and [Head of
Security](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink") all have energy guns in their
quarters. More are stored in the armoury and can be ordered in a [secure
crate](/wiki/Supply_crates#SECURITY "wikilink") by the
[quartermasters](quartermaster "wikilink"). They are to be distributed
only under the [most extreme
circumstances](/wiki/Space_law#Major_Crimes "wikilink").

### <img src="Laser.png" title="fig:Laser.png" alt="Laser.png" width="64" />Laser Gun

Distributed by the [Warden](/wiki/Warden "wikilink")- It is a more lethal
version of the [energy gun](energy_gun "wikilink") and lacks a
non-lethal function. Usually distributed along with [Riot
Shields](/wiki/Riot_Shields "wikilink") in extreme cases. It is very heavy,
useful for the beating up of people. A ranged energy weapon that shoots
lasers, which deal a great deal of brute damage. The bolts fire through
glass and grills. These also can be ordered by the
[quartermasters](quartermaster "wikilink") in a [secure weapons
crate](/wiki/Supply_crates#SECURITY "wikilink"), which itself can only able to
be opened by a [security](security "wikilink") officer or military head
of staff, It can be recharged.

### <img src="Laser.png" title="fig:Laser.png" alt="Laser.png" width="64" /> Practice Laser Gun

A modified version of the laser gun, this one fires less concentrated
energy bolts designed for target practice. It is found and used at the
Firing Range.

Department](/wiki/Supply_Crates "wikilink") or through an armory random spawn.
Ammo available in the [Autolathe](/wiki/Autolathe "wikilink") Six types of
shells can be used:

-   <img src="Slshell.png" title="fig:Slshell.png" alt="Slshell.png" width="64" />
    Slug Shell- Very Harmful. Standard shotgun shell.
-   <img src="Shotgun_shell_red.png" title="fig:Shotgun_shell_red.png" alt="Shotgun_shell_red.png" width="64" />

This is an advanced piece of equipment because it is so difficult to
use. Also distributed by SecTech vendors or the Warden. In room breaches
where multiple or armed personnel are expected, you may use a flashbrang
to "breach' the room. Select it, press the button, and throw it
immediately. It will blind everyone nearby for a short period of time
and deafen them for a longer period of time. If all goes well, they will
be on the ground, having dropped their weapons, and awaiting your
handcuffs.

` S.O.P If you are in a situation that requires flashbangs. CALL for backup.`

armory; this pistol is the pinnacle of sidearm technology, using .45
calibre bullets. (Found in the [Autolathe](/wiki/Autolathe "wikilink"). The
availability of lethal and non-lethal shells makes this a well rounded
weapon for all scenarios.

A machine gun that uses top-mounted 9mm magazines; it can be ordered
through [Cargo](/wiki/Supply_Crates "wikilink") or found in the armory. Used
in emergencies where heavy, yet reliable firepower is needed; and the
need for an intact suspect is paramount. The availability of lethal and
non-lethal magazines in the [Autolathe](/wiki/Autolathe "wikilink") for this
gun also vary its uses.

### <img src="Z8.png" title="fig:Z8.png" alt="Z8.png" width="64" />Z8 Bulldog

There's little to be said here! Wear it! It is very important to keeping
you safe. You can find replacements in lockers found in the [main
office](main_office "wikilink") as well as within the arrival
checkpoint. If these supplies have been exhausted, the
[Warden](/wiki/Warden "wikilink") can provide you with some. Its for the
