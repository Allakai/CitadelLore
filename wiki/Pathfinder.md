A great leader is born from hard work and determination. Leaders are
those that can find the way even in the darkest of night! Even as their
subordinates one by one down a abominations **gullet**. It's not a easy
or a pretty job, but darn does it feel good when the plan goes right for
a change.

Setup
-----

While the process may be daunting to some, the feeling of executing a
fast and efficient setup is more then worth it. Upon arriving on the
station, you should check with the other head's of staff to make sure
station set up is finished. Upon doing so you can begin the task of
working with any explorer personal to define possible mission
parameters. This includes requesting permission from the present
Research Director, should one not be found the next higher up should be
contacted. Upon receiving the go ahead you may start the argues task of
supplying your waiting explorers.

Exploring
---------

Just before setting out with your motley crew for <s>Death</s> science.
A few things should be considered, the main important one being who
currently on your team. If a **[Research
Directo](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink")r** is currently with you, they
are required to follow your orders while off station. Next before you
leave you should without a doubt be familiar with the **[Standard
Operating
Procedures](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure#Scientific_Expeditions "wikilink")**
as you will need to enforce them. Otherwise, once you are off world it
is your job to <s>babysit</s> command your squad to a mission success!

Away Team
---------

It is suggested to have a varied set of skills on your team. Standard
Operating Procedure Recommends...

-   Pathfinder or [Research Director](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink")
-   Any available [Explorers](/wiki/Explorer "wikilink")
-   An [Engineer](/wiki/Station_Engineer "wikilink")
-   A [Scientist](/wiki/Scientist "wikilink")
-   One [Medical personnel](/wiki/Job_Guides#Medical "wikilink")
-   A [Pilot](/wiki/Pilot "wikilink")

Volunteers may also join at their own risk after signing a waiver and
showing one of the required skills above.

Weaponry and You
----------------

Unlike the rest of science, who are not permitted to leave the R&D area
with live weapons, you are permitted to carry weapons to further your
job as necessary, but **only to and from the shuttle or gateway**
<s>legally, anyway</s>. For legal purposes, you should leave your
weapons in R&D or Security when going off-duty. Any explorer weapons
recovered by a [Search and Rescue](/wiki/Search_and_Rescue "wikilink") crew
member for example, should be <s>kept to defend against wily
predators</s> turned over to R&D or Security for safe keeping.

Security is within their rights to charge you with possessing
contraband, should you be searched for some other offense while not on
duty. If you assault someone in the bar and while being processed
security discovers your x-ray laser, you *may* be charged with
possessing major contraband.
