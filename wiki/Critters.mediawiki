This is the guide to pets and other critters.

=What you need to know about critters=
Critters are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence, not to be confused with the [[AI]]. This AI is remarkably limited in many respects, which most often manifests in subpar pathfinding and limited reaction to the physics systems that human controlled mobs have to deal with. This makes them unpredictable and frustrating as both allies and opponents.

Critters are divided into four categories:
