##### **Welcome to the VORE Station background page!**

<div class="mw-collapsible-content">

This is the starting page into VORE Station's lore, also commonly known
as 'fluff' (but we usually just call it lore). This is the basic, common
knowledge that the vast majority of characters should know and helps
introduce you, the player, into the world of our server. While you do
not have to know every little detail by heart it would be wise to skim
through some of the pages. At least to know how our lore differs to the
other SS13 servers.

Many wiki lore pages are constantly under construction and open to
change, If you feel like you may have something to add, please join our
[discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/0yCTdQTDRZL5CFSN) and pop your
head into the \#Lore channel. **Note:** *Unlike other pages of this
wiki, changes to these pages must be approved by our Loremaster or
another admin.*

Once again welcome to VORE Station, we hope your stay here is a long and
enjoyable one!

![Virgo Prime](Virgo-Prime.jpg "fig:Virgo Prime")The year is CE (Common
Era). With the help of massive [colony ships](colony_ship "wikilink"),
humanity had slowly spread and colonized our sun's neighboring systems.
[Alpha Centauri](/wiki/Alpha_Centauri "wikilink"), [Tau
Ceti](/wiki/Tau_Ceti "wikilink"), [Sirius](Sirius "wikilink") and more are
connected by a network of [warpgates](/wiki/Warpgate "wikilink") that makes
travel between systems take as little as hours instead of decades. With
the discovery of the seemingly supernatural [phoron](phoron "wikilink"),
[Bluespace](/wiki/Bluespace "wikilink"), and the acquisition of [Terraforming
Machines](/wiki/Terraforming "wikilink"), on-ship [FTL
drives](/wiki/Faster-than-Light_Travel "wikilink") became a possibility,
increasing the speed at which humanity expanded and colonized the stars
at a never before imagined rate.

We aren't alone in this endeavor, the [Skrell](/wiki/Skrell "wikilink"),
[Akula](/wiki/Akula "wikilink"), [Unathi](/wiki/Unathi "wikilink"),
[Tajaran](/wiki/Tajaran "wikilink"), and more explore the stars alongside of
us, expanding the frontier ever further for knowledge and profit.

However, danger lurks just around the corner. From hostile aliens like
the [Vox](/wiki/Vox "wikilink"), other, unknown entities whose true names are
only whispered in the shadows and existence kept hidden from the common
person, are blamed for damaging and causing the disappearances of ships,
stations, and [colonies](colonies "wikilink") out on the frontier.
[Phoron](/wiki/Phoron "wikilink"), as beneficial as it is, is still relatively
unknown and all of its dangers even more so. Finally, space itself is a
cruel, uncaring mistress that countless have lost their lives to, from
something as simple as a tear in their space suit to something more
sinister to mankind being its own worst enemy.

It's a brave new world.

Welcome to the Frontier
-----------------------

Welcome to [Virgo-Erigone](/wiki/Virgo-Erigone "wikilink") (or Virgo for
short), a system on the edge of colonized human space, the frontier. You
are assigned to work on a moon orbiting
[Virgo-3](/wiki/Virgo-Prime "wikilink"), one of only two
[phoron](phoron "wikilink") giants in known space. Several
[Trans-Stellar
Corporations](/wiki/List_of_Trans-Stellar_Corporations "wikilink") (TSC's)
including [NanoTrasen Systems Inc.](/wiki/NanoTrasen "wikilink") (NTS), the
[Free Trade Union](/wiki/Free_Trade_Union "wikilink") (FTU) and countless
independents hoping to strike it big at
[Virgo-Prime](/wiki/Virgo-Prime "wikilink") are all vying for control of the
system. Virgo lacks a stable [warpgate](warpgate "wikilink"), relying
instead on ships capable of [faster than light (FTL)](/wiki/FTL "wikilink")
speeds, so [Sol Central](/wiki/Sol_Central "wikilink")'s presence in this
system is almost nonexistent. In Virgo, NanoTrasen is the de-facto
governing body of the star system. They supply all the housing, nearly
all of the infrastructure, all emergency services, and employ numerous
[military contractors](/wiki/Mercenary "wikilink") to provide security—some of
whom may or may not be playing both sides of any given conflict.

The universally accepted currency by all but a select few systems and
regions is the [Thaler](/wiki/Thaler "wikilink"), which is backed and
supported by Sol Central and its
[allies](/wiki/Sol_Central#Allies "wikilink"). It is represented by the symbol
"$" (e.g. $130). With the advances of technology, the overall standard
of living and education is high even out in the frontier, though glaring
examples still exist (Like the [colony](colonies "wikilink") [Tenebre
Lupus](/wiki/Tenebre_Lupus "wikilink"), whose supporting companies had
completely collapsed and left them stranded, for example).

Life in Virgo
-------------

Out in the frontier, employers, be they a captain of a [Free
Trade](/wiki/Free_Trade_Union "wikilink") vessel, a
[Trans-Stellar](/wiki/List_of_Trans-Stellar_Corporations "wikilink")
executive, or just someone with money to spare and in need of an extra
hand, are forced to take just about whoever is willing and apparently
able. With [Sol](/wiki/Sol "wikilink") being months worth of spaceflight
away—even with faster than light travel—running a full background check
on a candidate is not viable, which means many questionable people get
placed in even the most high-security positions and loyalty is 'by your
word', which means in Virgo, corporate backstabbing and criminal
activity is quite high. This and a lack of available employees in
general means employees who do prove themselves often find themselves
promoted quickly, and put into positions that they are even the
slightest bit capable of.

Unlike in systems where the Sol has more influence such as
[Nyx](/wiki/Nyx "wikilink"), [Vir](Vir "wikilink"), or [Tau
Ceti](/wiki/Tau_Ceti "wikilink"), the population in Virgo is a rich melting
pot of sentient species, be they natively born, hybrids, or outright
artificial and made of genetically modified flesh or carefully crafted
silicon. Your coworkers will often include alien species, some of which
you might recognize, and others that you'll be seeing for the first
time. Due to exposure to so many different cultures, many of these
aliens have lost their accents or cultural identities.

Due to the lack of an official government, NanoTrasen is the de facto
ruling body in the Virgo-Erigone system, as no other faction has the
resources to provide social services, infrastructure, and security like
NanoTrasen does. Most of the citizens living on Virgo-Prime are
employees of the corporation or part of a subcontracted company that
does business with NanoTrasen.

Many of the inhabitants of Virgo-Prime fly off-world to work aboard the
.

### [Humans](/wiki/Humans "wikilink")

[left](file:Background-humans.png "wikilink") **Home planet**:
[Earth](/wiki/Earth "wikilink")

**Home system**: [Sol](/wiki/Sol "wikilink")

Humanity, everything and nothing can be said about them. They are the
primary driving force for rapid space expansion and perhaps the most
populated (known and sentient) species in the galaxy. From atop their
[SolGov](/wiki/United_Systems_of_Sol_Central "wikilink") throne their economic
prowess helps secure a position on the galactic stage. The vast majority
of [Trans-Stellar Corporations](/wiki/Trans-Stellar_Corporations "wikilink")
are owned by humans, and the mighty USDF is the main military presence
in any system where humans make up the majority of the inhabitants. By
this time men and women are treated all but equal, however there may
still be exceptions.

While most humans are accepting of other species and simply want to earn
an honest paycheck, the best and worst are found among them. You never
know what a human is going to be like when you first meet them.

Due to their prevalence in current known space, and their ability to
encompass all traits, good and bad, humanity is often considered the
'status quo'.

### [Skrell](/wiki/Skrell "wikilink")

[left](file:Background-Skrell.png "wikilink") **Home planet**:
[Qerr'balak](/wiki/Qerr'balak "wikilink")

**Home system**: [Qerr'Vallis](/wiki/Qerr'Vallis "wikilink")

The Skrell is a species of amphibious humanoids, distinguished by their
green-blue gelatinous appearance and head tentacles. Skrell warble from
the world of [Qerrbalak](/wiki/Qerrbalak "wikilink") (or as the lore once
called it, [Jargon 4](/wiki/Jargon_4 "wikilink")), a humid planet with plenty
of swamps and jungles. Currently more technologically advanced than
humanity, they emphasize the study of the mind above all else.

Gender has little meaning to Skrell outside of reproduction, and in
fact, many other species have a difficult time telling the difference
between male and female Skrell apart. The most obvious signs (voice in a
slightly higher register, longer head-tails for females) are never a
guarantee.

Due to their scientific focus on the mind and body, Skrell tends to be
more peaceful and their colonization has been slow, swiftly outpaced by
humanity. They were the first contact sentient species, and are
humanity's longest and closest ally in space.

### [Teshari](/wiki/Teshari "wikilink")

[128px\|left](file:Background-Teshari.png "wikilink") **Home planet**:
[Qerr'balak](/wiki/Qerr'balak "wikilink")

**Home system**: [Qerr'Vallis](/wiki/Qerr'Vallis "wikilink")

The Teshari are reptilian pack predators from the Skrell homeworld.
While they evolved alongside the Skrell, their interactions with them
tended to be confused and violent, and until peaceful contact was made
they largely stayed in their territories on and around the poles, in
tundra terrain far too desolate and cold to be of interest to the
Skrell. In more recent times, the Teshari were technologically uplifted
by the Skrell to be a space-faring race of their own, one that's ready
to prove its worth to the galaxy at large.

### [Akula](/wiki/Akula "wikilink")

![](Background-Akula.png "fig:Background-Akula.png") **Home planet**:
Unknown

**Home system**: [Qerr'Vallis](/wiki/Qerr'Vallis "wikilink")

**(Akula Lore is pending a rewrite. Please follow what is written for
now until a later date.)**

The Akula is a species of amphibious humanoids like the Skrell, but have
an appearance very similar to that of a shark. They were first
discovered as a primitive race of underwater-dwelling tribal creatures
by the Skrell. At first they were not believed to be noteworthy, but the
Akula proved to be such swift and clever learners that the Skrell
reclassified them as sentients. Allegedly, the Akula was also the first
sentient life that the Skrell had ever encountered beside themselves,
and thus the two species became swift allies over the next few hundred
years. With the help of Skrellean technology, the Akula had their genome
modified to be capable of surviving in open air for long periods of
time. However, Akula even today still require a high humidity
environment to avoid drying out after a few days, which would make life
on an arid world like Virgo-Prime nearly impossible if it were not for
Skrellean technology to aid them.

Most Akula today consider Qerr'Vallis to be their home where they live
alongside their Skrell allies, while their true homeworld has been
forgotten over the ages. Akula still tell legends of their homeworld,
passed down through word of mouth, talking of great magical cities on
the bottom of the ocean in a galaxy far away. Skrell historians believe
a great tragedy befell the Akulan race which led to their near
extinction, and the tribal Akula they eventually discovered had actually
descended from the survivors of this once technologically advanced
species. The most widely accepted theory is that the Akula originally
hail from the [Andromeda](/wiki/Andromeda "wikilink") Galaxy. This is
supported by the fact that varying races of Akula have been found in
scattered tribal communities across the galaxy, some more
technologically advanced than others, but all without space travel of
their own. Unfortunately, no one has the technology today to make such a
journey to find out.

Gender as a cultural identity has little meaning to most Akula, which is
a result of Skrellean cultural influence, but the difference between
male and female among the Akula is much more obvious than with the
Skrell. Like humans and Tajaran, female Akula have large breasts and
curvaceous bodies, along with similar reproductive organs that appear
almost mammalian in nature. Food also plays a huge role in their
sexuality. The best way to an Akula's heart is through their stomach.
Their demeanor will often change to docile and flirtatious while
engorged with food—similar to Earthly sharks, or other shark-like
creatures on other worlds with life. It would turn out that the shark is
a popular evolutionary path for water-dwelling predators throughout the
cosmos.

Unlike the Skrell, Akula tends to be more arrogant and less intelligence
focused, and will often find themselves in trouble with the law outside
of Skrell controlled systems. Popular professions for Akula include
piracy, smuggling operations, mining, and mercenary work. However, due
to their mutual respect of the Skrell, most will not engage in hostile
activity against Skrell or other Akula.

### [Unathi](/wiki/Unathi "wikilink")

[left](file:Background-unathi.png "wikilink") **Home planet**:
[Moghes](/wiki/Moghes "wikilink")

**Home system**: [Uueoa-Esa](/wiki/Moghes#Astrology "wikilink")

The Unathi are a race of tall, reptilian humanoids that possess both
crocodile-like and serpent-like features. Their scales are hard and
plate-like, save for the softer ones that line the inside of their legs,
armpits, and groin. Originating from the planet of
[Moghes](/wiki/Moghes "wikilink"), the Unathi live in an extremely religious
society.

The Unathi generally believe in and closely follow a set of
[Decrees](/wiki/Unathi_Culture#Religion,_The_Unity "wikilink") laid out in
their belief system, The Unity. Unathi believes in living long,
prosperous, honorable and productive lives. They firmly believe in
improving the skills of their craft to reach a level where they can be
considered to have mastered it.

The Unathi were humanity's second alien contact, but due to their
aggressive nature, engaged in an interstellar war with humanity known as
the [Sol-Hegemony Conflict](/wiki/Sol-Hegemony_Conflict "wikilink"). Although
the conflict has long since ended, and relations have slowly improved,
Unathi are still often considered to be 'second-class' citizens and are
rarely seen in jobs other than where muscle is needed. It is also still
common for racial tensions to run high, although this is less common on
the outskirts of SolGov's grasp.

### [Tajaran](/wiki/Tajaran "wikilink")

![](Background-tajaran.png "fig:Background-tajaran.png") **Home
planet**: Meralar

**Home system**: Rarkajar

The Tajaran are a humanoid race possessing cat-like features. Hailing
from Meralar, they possess insulating fur and felinoid stability to
better survive in their harsh native environment. Their home planet is a
cold planet of vast tundra and arctic zones. For generations the Tajaran
were practically enslaved by the leading class who were recently
overthrown. Males and females are treated roughly equal. There are three
divisions of Tajaran, two being sensible, the other... not so much.

Tajaran is one of the more recent contacts humanity has encountered.
While plenty of Tajaran hold reservations with their new allies, overall
the alliance is accepted and welcome. Though, like the
[Unathi](/wiki/Unathi "wikilink"), plenty of humans take advantage of the less
than modern education, and it is rare to see a Tajaran in a position of
command outside of systems like Virgo where the human population is
limited.

### [Sergal](/wiki/Sergal "wikilink")

![](Background-Sergal-Northen.png "fig:Background-Sergal-Northen.png")
[left](file:Background-Sergal-Southern.png "wikilink") **Home planet**:
[Tal](/wiki/Vilous#Tal "wikilink")

**Home system**: [Vilous](/wiki/Vilous "wikilink")

**(Sergal Lore is pending a rewrite. Please follow what is written for
now until a later date.)**

There are two subspecies of Sergal, Southern and Northern. Northern
sergals are a highly aggressive race that lives in the plains and tundra
of their homeworld. They are characterized by long, fluffy fur bodies
with cold colors; usually with white abdomens, somewhat short ears, and
thick faces. Southern sergals are much more docile and live in the [Gold
Ring City](/wiki/Gold_Ring_City "wikilink") and are scattered around the
outskirts in rural areas and small towns. They have short, brown or
yellow (or other "earthy" colors) fur, long ears, and a long, thin face.
They are smaller than their Northern relatives. Both have strong racial
tensions which have resulted in more than a number of wars and outright
attempts at genocide. The southern sergals have mostly been on the
losing side of this long conflict. Sergals have an incredibly long
lifespan, but due to their lust for violence and a nasty habit of
occasional cannibalism, only a handful have ever survived beyond the age
of 80, such as the infamous and legendary General Rain Silves who is
claimed to have lived to 5000. Although General Rain's historical
existence is disputed, she is nonetheless a symbol of the Sergal's
warrior culture.

Despite advances in technology, militant Sergals still wear metal or
leather armor and usually favor polearms or bladed weapons, and are
capable of great physical feats thanks to their strong, wiry limbs with
much denser muscles than humans, more akin to a chimpanzee's muscles.
They are reluctant to embrace new technology and pride themselves on the
old ways. Despite this, they have made great use of short-range space
travel and have colonized much of their home system. This is not,
however, to say they are not intelligent. Their intellect rivals that of
the Skrell but is focused mainly on military tactics and strategy,
rather than science or history.

Among sergals, females tend to be the dominant gender with larger, more
muscular and bulky bodies, and a much more aggressive demeanor,
especially among the northern race. This gender divide is most likely
born out of the legacy of General Rain, or perhaps General Rain is a
fictional character who is the result of this culture where females are
often commanders and warriors in vast armies while males are hunters and
farmers who may be one of multiple mates to a single female. Like many
mammal-like creatures, sergals have breasts, but females also have a
unique prehensile hood over their genitalia which protects it from dust
and infection.

Humanity encountered Sergals in the year 2524, when the [USDF
Pathfinder](/wiki/USDF_Pathfinder "wikilink") discovered the planet Tal, but
did not join the intergalactic community until late 2558 due to [The
Vilous Incident](/wiki/The_Vilous_Incident "wikilink"), wherein a total of
1,057 USDF personnel and somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 native
Sergals were killed in a brief military conflict. The Vilous system has
been under USDF occupation ever since, and has only recently been
officially annexed into [SolGov](/wiki/SolGov "wikilink")'s influence.

### [Promethean](/wiki/Promethean "wikilink")

![](Background-Promethians.png "fig:Background-Promethians.png") **Home
planet**: [Aetolus](/wiki/Aetolus "wikilink")

**Home system**: [Kataigal](/wiki/Kataigal "wikilink")

A gelatinous race of mimics evolved from their slime predecessors that
were first discovered aboard the NRS Prometheus, these colorful
humanoids are best characterized by their ability to repurpose and shape
their bodies for whatever a situation may warrant by means of their
semi-solid structure. Along with this is their semipermeable membrane
encasing their gel, allowing them to filter feed while keeping the
undesirable matter out of their bodies. Their composition allows them to
resist most sources of brute trauma, though energy will cause their
limbs to become unstable and disintegrate. Prometheans are also void of
most normal organs, only possessing a core and cytoskeleton, both of
which are crucial to the slime's survival.

Being an artificially created race, and a new one at that, Prometheans
have no unified culture, though there are small populations of
Prometheans scattered around the universe, the tropical planet of
[Aetolus](/wiki/Aetolus "wikilink") in particular having roughly one thousand
such individuals. Currently, Prometheans *must* have a caretaker in
accordance with USDF regulations, normally a xenobiologist or other
trained caretaker.

### [Nevrean](/wiki/Nevrean "wikilink")

[left](file:Background-Nevrean.png "wikilink") **Home planet**:
[Eltus](/wiki/Vilous#Eltus "wikilink")

**Home system**: [Vilous](/wiki/Vilous "wikilink")

**(Sergal Lore is pending a rewrite, which will also effect Nevreans.
Please follow what is written for now until a later date.)**

An avian species hailing from the planet Eltus in the Vilous system,
characterized by their long whiplike tail-feathers. The species is
generally matriarchal, with females tending towards duller, brown
coloration and bulkier bodies, while males are slight and brightly
colored. In both typical mannerisms, culture and physical build, the
sexes are directly reversed when compared to traditional human society.
Their build is somewhere between a bird and a feathered dinosaur.
Females tend to have short feathers on their arms that are not capable
of flight, while males often have more developed flight-feathers -
on-station, these are often kept tucked away and folded under their
jumpsuit sleeves.

There are no remaining records describing how the Nevreans came to leave
Eltus and relocate to Tal - they have little to no written history from
that time, having a tradition of oral history and song, and most of what
little history survives of their former homeworld is couched in myth,
legend, stories, fairy tales and adventures. Humanity has not yet had
time to study these stories and separate fact from fiction, and reality
from metaphor, or what parts of the stories might hint at the
then-primitive race having a visit from a spacefaring species. As a
result, Eltus has attracted no small amount of interest from
xenoarchaeologists.

After the exodus, Nevreans coexisted alongside Sergals, though tend to
be much more forward-looking when it comes to new technology. While
sergals still tended towards traditional melee weapons and armor in
battle, Nevreans have no such hangups when it comes to more modern
armaments and has earned a reputation as crafters and engineers in urban
communities. Likewise, the urban groups have tended to adopt the written
languages of other cultures, nevreans lacking any written form of their
own tongue.

During [The Vilous Incident](/wiki/The_Vilous_Incident "wikilink"), most
nevrean communities avoided confrontation, though a handful of urban
groups took to asymmetric warfare tactics against USDF special forces
when fighting entered the city.

### [Diona](/wiki/Diona "wikilink")

![](Background-Dioan.png "fig:Background-Dioan.png") **(( Whitelisted
species - requires a special character application to play. ))**

**Home system**: [Epsilon Ursae
Majoris](/wiki/Epsilon_Ursae_Majoris "wikilink")

The diona are a group of omnivorous, slow-metabolism plantlike organisms
that are in fact clusters of individual, smaller organisms. They exhibit
a high degree of structural flexibility and come in a wide variety of
shapes and colors to reflect the intelligence of each individual
creature. They were discovered by the Skrell in 2294CE, not on a planet,
but in open space between three stars, a figurative hell that made it
difficult to discover, much less contact them.

Diona spread by seeds and are asexual, no gender. When grown into their
small 'nymph' state, they are known to eat large amounts of dead plant
matter and fertilize plants while they learn from those around them by
sampling their genetic code (usually through blood extractions), and as
they grow further merger into larger and larger forms. It is not unheard
of for Skrell explorers to be traveling in a ship composed of habitat
modules and engines of Skrell make, with the body of the ship formed by
their Diona allies to warble across the cosmos.

Introduced by the Skrell, and quite slow and peaceful, the Diona share
good relations with humanity.

### [Synthetics](/wiki/Synthetics "wikilink")

[128px\|left](file:Background-Synthmorph.gif "wikilink") Synthetics are
spread throughout known space and serve a myriad variety of roles that
range from a tiny drone scrubbing a floor to a nearly omnipotent AI used
in a combat-ready interstellar vessel. Most known sufficiently-advanced
races use synthetics in some way; very often as prosthetic bodies when
their own bodies fail. There are three basic kinds of synthetic
intelligences found in the universe today:

-   **Drone**: A drone is the term for any synthetic that uses more
    simple artificial intelligence constructs such as chips or
    motherboards. While capable of very sophisticated interaction, they
    are, in essence, only expert systems and not truly sapient.
-   **Cyborg**: A cyborg is a synthetic that uses an organic brain to
    function via an MMI, short for Man-Machine Interface. Cyborgs come
    in many shapes and sizes and most sentient cyborgs are free-willed.
    Some companies have used canine brains and brains of other animals
    to ensure a cheap workforce that doesn't rely on cutting-edge
    technology.
-   **Positronic Brain**: Positronic Brains are synthetic intelligences
    equaling the intellect of a particularly clever sapient being and
    are generalized artificial intelligences that can be seen as equal
    (or superior) to organic sapience. They possess a neural network not
    dissimilar to a brain made out of flesh; and are often used when
    expert systems simply do not make the cut and a true intelligence is
    needed. Many positronic intelligences strive for self-determination
    and are often acknowledged to be holders of their own destiny.

Synthetics have the unique capability of serving in different bodies.
This can take shape of a [Synthmorph](/wiki/Synthmorph "wikilink"), a
[lawbound AI](/wiki/AI "wikilink"), or [lawbound mobile
chassis](/wiki/Cyborg "wikilink"). However, transition from one to the other
is often more expensive than the net worth of the bodies and is thus
done sparingly.

The fox-like Zorren are native to Virgo-Prime, however there are two
distinct varieties of Zorren one with large ears and shorter fur, and
the other with longer fur that is a bit more vibrant. The long-eared,
short-furred Zorren have come to be known as "Flatland" Zorren as that
is where most of their settlements are located. The Flatland Zorren are
somewhat tribal and shamanistic as they have only recently started to be
hired by the Trans-Stellar Corporations. The other variety of Zorren are
known as "Highland" Zorren as they frequently settle in hilly and/or
mountainous areas, they have a differing societal structure than the
Flatland Zorren having a more feudal social structure, like the Flatland
Zorren, the Highland Zorren have also only recently been hired by the
Trans-Stellar Corporations, but thanks to the different social structure
they seem to have adjusted better to their new lives. Though similar
fox-like beings have been seen they are different than the Zorren.

### [Vulpkanin](/wiki/Vulpkanin "wikilink")

[left](file:Background-Vulpkanin.png "wikilink") **Home Planet**: Altam

**Home System**: Vazzend

Vulpkanin or "Vulpa" is a species of sharp-witted canid bipeds residing
on the planet Altam just barely within the binary Vazzend system. Their
politically de-centralized society and independent natures have led them
to become a species and culture both feared and respected for their
scientific breakthroughs. Discovery, loyalty, and utilitarianism
dominate their lifestyles to the degree it can cause conflict with more
rigorous and strict authorities. They speak a guttural language known as
'Canilunzt' which has a heavy emphasis on utilizing tail positioning and
ear twitches to communicate intent.

Vulpkanin are an omnivorous (with preference of meat and fish) bipedal
furred race vaguely reminiscent of Terran vulpines, and in some cases,
reminiscent of Terran Canines. Colorations are usually subdued but vary
considerably on genetics, climate, and personal taste. Vulpa descended
from the northern latitudes tend towards whites and rarely, very slight,
almost unnoticeable blue tints. Vulpa descended from a more equatorial
climate tend towards brighter browns and dusty reds. Vulpkanin in the
between of both latitudes tend towards greys, muted reds, blacks, and
tans. Bright colors, excluding whites from the arctic region, are
unnatural as they are often dyes used by younger minded Vulpkanin to
stand out from littermates. Genetic resequencing can make an otherwise
impossible color a standard which has become a trend not unlike human
'tattoo' culture.

Vazzend is a system undergoing significant solar activity due to the
orbital habits of the primary F class star, Vazzend A also known as
'Kol', which due to the interaction between it and the M class star,
Vazzend B 'Gol', causes large bouts of electromagnetic energy pulse out
at significant range. The cycle is infrequent, but of great fascination.
It was also a terror during the early industrial age of the Vulpkanin
peoples when they had just started to unlock the principles of
electricity. Altam is the second planet of 4 orbiting Gol, which is near
Earth-like conditions, if a touch warmer during summer. Jungles are
thick, Forests are about the same, deserts larger and oceans a smidge
smaller.

These flares promoted the cultural drive to discover what, why, and how
and gave the entire civilization a means to reach for the stars through
scientific focus. One of their most prized technologies is the degree of
EM resistance built into everything they develop; enabling the small
fleet of space, then starships to be nearly impossible to disable with
ionic weaponry. It was this tech that promoted interest from the
Federation and NanoTrasen directly for use in insulating sensitive power
equipment, such as harnessing singularities larger than a few microns in
size.

With access to both the stars and employment, Vulpkanin people are
quickly finding themselves as honest working Engineers and Scientists
for hire, their propensity for group efforts using the meticulous use of
their materials ensures they're highly prized to any project team. They
are also apt security officers and wardens due to the hierarchical
mindset of the pack, but only a rare handful have the traits to actually
lead as an alpha.

### [Vasilissans](/wiki/Vasilissans "wikilink")

[left](file:Background-Vasilissans.png "wikilink") **Home planet**:
Varilak

**Home system**: Antares

Vasilissans are a carnivorous, large spider-like people with tall, lanky
bipedal bodies covered in chitin, and four large spider-like limbs
protruding from their backs. They come in a variety of colors and are
extremely diverse in that aspect. The females are usually about a foot
taller than the males, averaging in at about seven feet. The females are
also much stronger than the males. Their faces have four eyes of solid
and varying colors. On the top of their heads are strange, thick,
leg-like feelers that are normally styled in much the same way as hair.
Their color varies greatly and isn’t normally the same color as the
Vasilissan’s body. They have several feelers and sharp claw-like limbs
around their lipped human-like mouths. These mouths contain only fangs,
a strange, bulbous, long tongue, and spinnerets, giving them the ability
to spit large strands of silk from their mouths. Their faces are
traditionally very pretty, long, and elegant, almost elf-like despite
their hard chitin plating and lack of a nose.

From a temperate jungle planet, the Vasilissans were once a solitary,
territorial people until great queens began to subjugate them. These
'Star Queens' ruled with an iron fist and urged their subjects to expand
her territory and to attempt to build great towering cities tall enough
to reach the stars and their sun, which they believed to be gems of
great magical power and spiritual significance. They were eventually
picked up and ‘uplifted’ by NT due to their world being rich in precious
metals, but their ability to design and create vast, strong, and
luxurious structures with their silk, stood out well among their
talents, and due to their naturally somewhat solitary natures, they make
great scouts and explorers.

### [Xenochimera](/wiki/Xenochimera "wikilink")

[left](file:Background-Xenochimera.png "wikilink") **(( Whitelisted
species - requires a special character application to play. ))**

**Home planet**: Not known

**Home system**: Not known

An extraterrestrial colony organism, xenochimera are unusual in that
they have no real defining physiology of their own - effectively,
xenochimera mimic other beings, or parts of other beings, by consuming
them and mutating their own cellular structure to imitate whatever
evolutionary advantages they may find - or in layman's terms, they eat
other creatures and copy features to create bizarre hybrids. As a
result, no two examples of the species are alike, and they can, in fact,
be wildly different in appearance.

Xenochimera are highly unusual and rare creatures, and thus of great
interest to Nanotrasen's xenobiology division. Owing to the moral and
legal constraints surrounding experimentation on (arguably) sentient
creatures, NT's Landside Science Division on Virgo Prime has suggested
simply hiring them with the hope that doing so will allow the company to
observe and study them in a way that locking them in a xenobio pen would
not - and if the scientists on the station can persuade them to
*volunteer* themselves for examination, that's a bonus.

### [Xenomorph-Hybrid](/wiki/Xenomorph-Hybrid "wikilink")

[left](file:Background-Xenomorph-Hybrid.png "wikilink") **(( Whitelisted
species - requires a special character application to play. ))**

**Home planet**: N/A

**Home system**: N/A

Xenomorph hybrids are an extraterrestrial species. The origins of
xenomorphs are primarily unknown, although hybrids have been formed
through various ways. One of the most common ways they are created is by
genetic experimentation. This is done either by
[splicing](splicing "wikilink") xenomorph DNA into a humanoid, or
splicing humanoid DNA into a xenomorph, although the former is much more
common. This process creates a hybrid of the two species with them
sharing various traits.

Some of the traits xenomorph hybrids have are: A thick chitinous
exoskeleton of varying hardness, much like a lobster, an elongated
curved head, a toothed maw which hides a proboscis-like inner mouth, a
jaw somewhat similar to a moray eel, green blood of varying acidity, a
vertebrate-like body, and a long flexible tail. This can vary from
hybrid to hybrid.

Additionally, most, if not all hybrids **do not** appear to share the
hive-mind that most feral xenomorphs seem to possess, along with their
ability to produce resin, and their increased ability to sense prey.
This can also be assumed to be due to the intensive mutation process.

### [Angels](/wiki/Angels "wikilink") and [Demons](/wiki/Demons "wikilink")

[left](file:Background-Angels.png "wikilink") **Home planet**: Sanctorum

**Home system**: Sanctum

[left](file:Background-Demons.png "wikilink") **Home planet**: Infernum

**Home system**: Sanctum

[Angels](/wiki/Angels "wikilink") are a species of winged humanoids. They
essentially look like humans but have white feathered wings and a much
lighter body. Their bones are hollowed similarly to birds and retain
little fat. Sanctum's society isn't commonly known about, while Infernum
might have a few more words because of it's tourists. Their society
tends to have an elegant yet minimalist taste to it, due to their early
post-scarcity state. The majority of their work tends to be automated
with the use of machines, and their medicines are advanced. They a
significantly older race than many of the others. There are Angels who
are heavily genetically modified, who tend to live in Infernum. They are
known as [Demons](/wiki/Demons "wikilink").

### [Rapala](/wiki/Rapala "wikilink")

[left](file:Rapala-background.png "wikilink") **Home planet**: Verita

**Home system**: Kastra-71

An Avian species, coming from a distant planet, the Rapalas are the very
proud race. Sol researchers have commented on them having a very close
resemblance to the mythical race called 'Harpies', who are known for
having massive winged arms and talons as feet. They've been clocked at
speeds of over 35 miles per hour chasing the planet's many fish-like
faunae. The Rapalan's home-world 'Verita' is a strangely habitable gas
giant, while no physical earth exists, there are fertile floating
islands orbiting around the planet from past asteroid activity."

**Home system:** [Beta-Carnelium
Ventrum](/wiki/Beta-Carnelium_Ventrum "wikilink")

The Alraune are the native species of a planet within the Territory of
Sanctum, concurrently under protection for them to develop on their own
pace. However, previous to this non-contact policy, many Alraune were
displaced by angels as companions and pet projects in uplifting,
ultimately leading to a Diaspora of more culturally advanced Alraune
living on Sanctum, Virgo-Erigone, Vilous and other Virgo-Erigone
colonies.

### [Sylvanus](/wiki/Sylvanus "wikilink") (Elves)

[left](file:Elves-background.png "wikilink")
[200px\|thumbnail\|right\|This region of space is impossible to see from
Earth-based telescopes, as it is blocked by the densely arranged stars
of the galactic core. Nearly all star systems within this shadow are
unexplored.](file:Observational-Shadow.png "wikilink") **Home planet:**
[Ashkel](/wiki/Ashkel "wikilink")

**Home system:** \[DATA NOT FOUND\]

Sylvanusians, colloquially known as 'Elves' due to their pointed ears,
are a humanoid species believed to have originated from somewhere within
Earth's observational shadow. Little is known about the origin of their
species, but among what is known is that the Sylvanussi species far
predates that of Humans or possibly even the Skrell. Sylvanussi colonies
exist scattered throughout the far reaches of the galaxy, but very few
have expanded beyond their own system, such as [Scion](/wiki/Scion "wikilink")
Sylvanussians. Those who have expanded usually only occupy perhaps two
or three local star systems, and often possess technology considered
primitive by modern standards.

A notable exception however is the [Auream
Imperium](/wiki/Auream_Imperium "wikilink"), whose technology and military
might seems to rival that of even [SolGov](/wiki/SolGov "wikilink"). Even
still, Auream Sylvanussians are especially known for their highly
secretive behavior, and will betray few details about their culture, or
even the whereabouts of their home planet. Xenoanthropolists believe
that the reason for this is that Auream Sylvanussians fear conflict with
the galactic superpower that is SolGov. Whether the Auream Imperium's
apparent might is legitimate or mere posturing is not yet known.

The Auream Imperium has taken a peculiar interest with the
[Virgo-Erigone](/wiki/Virgo-Erigone "wikilink") system, though the reasons why
have not been clearly stated.

Important Groups
----------------

### [Trans-Stellar Corporations](/wiki/List_of_Trans-Stellar_Corporations "wikilink")

These are the big corporate forces, major companies whose reach cover
numerous star systems and are nearly government forces of their own.
While [Sol Central](/wiki/Sol_Central "wikilink") does keep them in check to
make certain nothing too inhumane or against humanity's interest is
being performed, they actually police each other in a way. Keep in mind
while many corporations do have their own security forces, some of them
armed well enough to make some governmental military forces jealous,
they are all used for 'asset protection'.

The major seven trans-stellars are: [NanoTrasen](/wiki/NanoTrasen "wikilink"),
[Ward-Takahashi GMB](/wiki/Ward-Takahashi_GMB "wikilink"), [Gilthari
Exports](/wiki/Gilthari_Exports "wikilink"), [Grayson Manufactories
Ltd.](/wiki/Grayson_Manufactories_Ltd. "wikilink"), [Aether Atmospherics and
Recycling](/wiki/Aether_Atmospherics_and_Recycling "wikilink"), [Zeng-Hu
Pharmaceuticals](/wiki/Zeng-Hu_Pharmaceuticals "wikilink") and [Hesphaistos
Industries](/wiki/Hesphaistos_Industries "wikilink").

Other important trans-stellars are: [Vey-Med](/wiki/Vey-Med "wikilink"),
[Advent Life Biolabs](/wiki/Advent_Life_Biolabs "wikilink"), [Aerospace Combat
Escort Services](mercenary "wikilink") (aka ACES),
[RauMauser](/wiki/RauMauser "wikilink"), [Donk Co.](Donk_Co. "wikilink"), and
[Cybersun Industries](/wiki/Cybersun_Industries "wikilink").

### [Free Trade Union](/wiki/Free_Trade_Union "wikilink")

To keep the TSC's in check, and to help protect the smaller businesses
striving to just make a living, the Free Trade Union was formed 200
years ago. Each FTU branch is different from system to system, but each
offer lawyers, copyright enforcement, and even anti-pirate asset
protection forces for any non-TSC business. All FTU stations are
renowned for their open markets where all are welcomed to sell and
trade, even the [Vox](/wiki/Vox "wikilink"). They're the vocal defenders of
the mom and pop stores, basically.

### [Sol Central](/wiki/Sol_Central "wikilink")

The banner over which most of humanity is united under. They focus on
keeping humanity's best interest in check and tend to keep out of a
system's personal problems unless they are in a dire state of emergency.
They are protected by the USDF.

### [Military Groups](/wiki/Military_Groups "wikilink")

Not only are there corporate interests out in deep space, but also
military ones. These factions tend to be neutral to corporate empires
like NanoTrasen, but occasionally NanoTrasen will find its self in the
crossfire of an ongoing conflict.

The most well known trans-stellar military group is the [United Sol
Defense Forces](/wiki/United_Sol_Defense_Force "wikilink") (USDF), based out
of Earth in Sol Central, as well as its mostly defunct grandfather
organization, the United States Colonial Marines. NanoTrasen is
non-hostile to the USDF and has a number of lobbyists in Sol Central's
government to ensure the USDF's cooperation.

Another group, wary of the influence of Sol Central and hostile to any
Trans-Stellar Corporation is the [Ares
Confederation](/wiki/Ares_Confederation "wikilink"), a dozen of colony worlds
on the fringe of human-occupied space. Obviously, considering NT is one
of their "sworn" enemies, relationships are frosty at best, although no
open hostility broke out yet. They are cordial to both the Soviets and
the United Federation, while rumors persist that they back up the
Syndicate as well.

Also out of Sol Central is the [3rd Soviet
Union](3rd_Soviet_Union "wikilink"), which hails from
[Europa](/wiki/Europa "wikilink") and continues to exist despite tensions with
the USDF thanks to supporters from scattered colonies and sympathizers
across the galaxy providing weapons and resources. NanoTrasen maintains
a shakey neutrality with the Soviets, often through the exchange of
technology. The Soviets also purchase weapons from NanoTrasen to use
against the USDF.

Contrasty, there is the [Fourth Reich](/wiki/Nazis "wikilink"), which is a
small but rabidly fascist military group which preys upon the hearts of
disenfranchised citizens in colonies otherwise left for dead by groups
like NanoTrasen once the phoron has dried up. Originally overlooked by
NanoTrasen, the Fourth Reich became a threat during the [November
Crisis](/wiki/November_Crisis "wikilink") of 2558, where Reich forces fired
upon the [Virgo Orbital Research
Establishment](/wiki/Virgo_Orbital_Research_Establishment "wikilink") and [NDV
Brutus](/wiki/NDV_Brutus "wikilink"). The small [NDV
Icarus](/wiki/NDV_Icarus "wikilink") was also completely destroyed in the
conflict. The Reich is hostile toward the USDF, the Federation, and the
Soviets, but are generally neutral toward the Syndicate.

Finally, there is the infamous [Syndicate](/wiki/Syndicate "wikilink")
paramilitary group, of which cells still persist to this day from their
infamous inception back in 2262. The chapter operating within Vilous and
Virgo-Erigone is considered destroyed, however this does not stop
independent mercenaries, operatives and criminals turn up with their
equipment which has been salvaged in one way or another.

To defend against belligerent forces, NanoTrasen also employs a vast
number of mercenaries to serve in the [NanoTrasen Defense
Navy](/wiki/NanoTrasen_Defense_Navy "wikilink"), whose weapons and armaments
are a mishmash of hardware purchased from surplus USDF military
stockpiles or developed on their own.

Pirates and Smugglers
---------------------

Not all in the Virgo system seek to gain an honest paycheck. Crooks and
creeps are commonplace in a system like Virgo—far away from the
governing bodies that would otherwise stomp them out of existence.
<img src="BullPirateFlag.png" title="fig:Blackstar Marauders Emblem" alt="Blackstar Marauders Emblem" width="200" />

### Blackstar Marauders

Consisting of a variety of alien species, the Blackstar Marauders are a
group of ruthless space pirates once run by a man named Jarome
Rognvaldr. When their leader was imprisoned by NanoTrasen five years
ago, and later turned over to Earth government forces, the Blackstar
Marauders were eventually taken over by an unknown individual who
swiftly returned the group to its former glory as the largest piracy
group on the outskirts of inhabited space. They prey mostly on cargo
shuttles and fortunately a station like V.O.R.E. is of little interest
as a target, but they do still occasionally perform kidnappings for
ransom against NanoTrasen employees.

Some of their former members who have been arrested over the years,
including Jarome, now work for NanoTrasen. They are not to be trusted,
but still, have old connections to the black market if you need to make
a special order.

Hostile Forces
--------------

As mentioned before, there are several smaller antagonistic forces out
in Virgo, a brief overview of commonly known knowledge is below, further
information can be found on the [Identifying
Antagonists](/wiki/Identifying_Antagonists "wikilink") page:

### Disloyals

Virgo has many opportunities for less than loyal individuals to get
themselves into important positions. Reasons for betrayal are many: some
could be looking for money, have a personal agenda, extreme
political/religious ideals, suffering from some form of insanity, or
could be more than they appear. Either way, in Virgo, the wise watch
their back and do not give out their trust freely.
