Overview
--------

Not much is known about this occupation, as <s>no one's allowed to play
the fucking job</s> it is shrouded in mystery. What little is known
about the clown, is that they wear a mask, a silly outfit, and shoes
that don't fit, and <s>get gurgled for slipping someone with a banana
peel</s> play harmless pranks on their crew members. The tradition of
clownery dates back hundreds of years, to <s>a secret alien race of
clown people, hailing from the forbidden clown planet "Big Top"</s>
ancient Sol tradition.

Clown Traditions
----------------

Clowns have traditional rituals, that, while not confirmed by actual
documented data, have been passed down by word of mouth. The clown, as
per a nonverbal agreement, has the permission to <s>act like they have
brain damage</s> do things that would land a normal crew member in the
Psychiatrist's office, or worse, the Brig. These include, but are not
limited to: hiding your identity, <s>being a greytiding little piece
of</s> acquiring tools they don't really need, and using them for
[Hacking](/wiki/Hacking "wikilink") into places that don't come with their
occupation, and <s> annoying everyone </s> playing pranks on their
fellow crew, using tools such as, the slippery skin of the banana, the
horn from a bicycle, and many other things.
