As the **Station Psychologist**, you are tasked with identifying (and
solving) personal and mental issues within the station's crew. This is a
job that you may or [may not](/wiki/Traitor "wikilink") be able to accomplish
successfully. If need be, you have the power to deem someone mentally
unstable and, with the approval of the [Chief Medical
Officer](/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer "wikilink"), strip them of any authority
they [might've had.](/wiki/Captain "wikilink") Ultimately, you are responsible
for the mental health and well being of the crew. The Station
Psychologist isn't expected to know how to set up cryo, or treat
patients. They have no access to anything in medical aside from their
own office, general storage, the break room and the resleeving lab.

Psychology and You
------------------

This job is very roleplay-oriented, and it can be very boring if not
played correctly. More often than not, you will be spending your time
listening to your patients and then talking to them. Most of the players
who will approach you already have something in mind, and because there
is no easy, straightforward way to treat psychological issues, it falls
to you to make your patient's roleplay experience an enjoyable one.

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy centers around identifying a problem and
setting up a plan to fix it step by step. It focuses on developping
coping strategies that can help with the current problems with
cognitions, behavior and emotional regulation. For roleplay purposes
BCBT, or Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can be used following a step
by step plan.

**Orientation**

-   Have the patient declare a commitment to their treatment
-   Plan for crisis response and safety.
-   Restrict the patient's access to problematic objects, such as
    substances in case of addiction.
-   Put together a little survival kit of items that can help your
    patient through episodes.
-   Establish a reminder, like a card or a piece of paper with their
    motivation or reason to live on it.
-   Set up a treatment journal.
-   Make note of any lessons the patient has learned.

**Skill Focus**

-   Make a worksheet about how the patient is going to develop their
    skill to cope with their problem.
-   Give the patient reminders of how they are going to solve their
    problems. Like a sheet of paper or cards with suggestions printed on
    them.
-   Demonstrate how they'd use them.
-   Practice their usage with the patient
-   Refine their skill at solving their own problems.

**Preventing relapses**

-   Have your patient apply the solution frequently to themselves once
    they are good enough at it to do it on their own
-   Have your patient find ways in which the solutions you've reached
    would work even better.

**Treatable afflictions** Lesser forms of depression and anxiety, PTSD,
tics, substance abuse, eating disorders, borderline personality
disorder, OCD, major depressive disorder and psychosis. It may also help
with conduct disorders.

### EMDR

EMDR, or Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing, is a therapy
that helps relieve emotion from memories, reprocessing them and thus
aiding with solving trauma. It is a psychotherapy used to help with
symptoms of PTSD and helps threat memories that override normal coping
mechanisms.

**Asking questions** EMDR treatment consists of a series of five
questions, two of which are visualisation exercises, the rest measure
the patient's condition. During the second time the patient visualizes
their negative memories, the therapist either distracts their eyes with
a finger or uses headphones with an alternating click on the left and
right side to distract the patient.

-   Ask the patient about their traumatic experience, including
    associated thoughts, images and feelings.
-   Ask them to think of it again while distracting them with
-   Ask the patient how they feel.
-   Ask the patient how their body feels.
-   Ask the patient on a scale of 1 to 10, how much does their memory
    bother them?

If you get an answer of 6 or lower to the last question, you've got your
patient to the safe zone. Doing this constitutes a set, it is adviced to
take a break after a set. Up to three sets can safely be done, after
that side effects of headaches will show up. It will sometimes occur
that during a set another memory surfaces, pick up on it and process it
like you did the first.

**Other applications**

EMDR may also help with borderline personality disorder and phantom limb
pain.

### Pharmaceuticals

If you prefer to play the psychiatrist, you can prescribe a number of
anti-depressants, sedatives, painkillers, and other pharmaceutical drugs
in order to help your patient to recover. A list of all of the possible
drugs that may be prescribed can be found in the [guide to
chemistry](/wiki/Guide_to_Chemistry#Medicine "wikilink"). Please note though
for roleplay purposes that a psychologist is not actually a doctor, a
psychiatrist is.

### Psychosis & Violent Patients

So let's face it... not every patient you treat is going to be coming
into your office ready to talk politely about their problems. Sometimes,
you're going to be dealing with people who simply aren't thinking
straight, or who are even outright violent.

Hallucinations can be caused by drugs, poisons, and radiation. You'll
see them on a large scale if the supermatter goes critical, and on a
small scale if the [botanist](botanist "wikilink") or
[chemist](chemist "wikilink") has been producing recreational
substances. One type of antidepressant you can prescribe, paroxetine,
also has the risk of causing hallucinations, meaning that it should be
prescribed under your supervision or that of a member of the medical
staff. People who are hallucinating will see things, hear things, and
sometimes believe things that aren't actually there.

You will also deal with severe mental illness, including everything from
the effects of having found out that one has just been cloned to the
garden-variety schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety every psychologist
encounters. Most of the time, people who are mentally ill are not
violent. Some people who are hallucinating due to drugs or
radiation--especially if they've experienced it before--will know that
they're hallucinating and try to stay safe. But it's entirely possible
that a patient with psychosis will throw a punch at you, believing you
are trying to harm them. Your main goal when dealing with a
hallucinating patient is to keep them safe until the hallucinations wear
off, or the doctors can treat them for whatever is causing the
hallucinations.

Occasionally you will deal with a patient who is homicidal or suicidal.
Depending on how bad it is and how clearly they are thinking, you may be
able to simply talk them down, which is the preferred option, or you may
have to restrain them in some way.

In order of increasing urgency, treatments for psychiatric emergency can
include:

-   Antidepressants. These work slowly and are of the most help to
    people who are already somewhat rational. If a person is just barely
    in control, this can help.
-   Soporific pill or injection. A sedative will make your patient
    sleepy and help them calm down.
-   Straight jacket. This keeps your patient from hurting themselves,
    but it is uncomfortable and can even be traumatic. Only use it if
    your patient is in immediate danger.
-   Muzzle. This keeps your patient from speaking or biting--only really
    useful if they are desperate enough to try to chew their own hands
    off. Like the straitjacket, a last resort.
-   Chloral hydrate. This is a very strong sedative that causes overdose
    starting at only 15 units, but its strength means it can be put into
    an autoinjector and be effective at stopping anyone without armor on
    (ask the chemist to make you one). Once the chloral hydrate has
    taken effect, the patient can be more easily restrained, and its
    effects can be reversed with Dylovene.

#### Working with Security

-   Some of your patients will be criminals who happen to also have a
    mental illness. Others will be people who have come to Security's
    attention because of their erratic behavior. Either way, you may
    need to coordinate with Security to get these people treated.
-   Remember that the people you see as patients, Security may very well
    see as criminals. Advise Security as to the nature of the crisis and
    stress that your patient is hallucinating, depressed, confused, etc.
    Explain to them any particular triggers your patient may have.
-   Ensure that any physical injuries your patient has are taken care of
    first.
-   If Security has been unnecessarily rough with your patient, do not
    hesitate to make complaints. In many cases, you will be the only one
    speaking out on behalf of your patient's welfare.
-   Handcuffs are an effective way of restraining a patient while you
    speak to them, but just like a straitjacket, they are uncomfortable
    and can cause a patient to panic. If they're necessary for your
    safety, use them, but don't just slap them on your patients
    willy-nilly.
-   Don't be afraid to ask for a guard on a particularly violent
    patient. Letting your patient beat you up is not approved clinical
    practice.

### **Confidentiality and why it is important**

As the psychologist you will likely get to know very private and very
sensitive information about people, it is of the utmost importance that
you keep what is discussed between you, the patient and the Central
Command Mental Health department. If you start to talk and gossip about
all the intimate details of what is wrong with your patients, people
will no longer trust you and them no longer trusting you leads to them
not telling you the important details you need to do your job. Keep that
zipper shut, buddy. Medical confidentiality is no joke.

Antag Encounter
---------------

You may also encounter insanity in the form of a
[cult](cult "wikilink"). As a psychologist, you don't know anything
about the cult itself, but you will probably come to realize that they
are suffering from mental impairment unlike any you've seen
before--personalities altered, motives changed, and morals turned upside
down to the point that a pacifist may become a killer and a usually
joyful person may become a near-suicidal nihilist. How you respond to
this strange new type of psychosis is up to you--remember who your
character is. But your duty as a psychologist remains the same: Criminal
or not, violent or not, you treat mental illness and aid those who
suffer from it. Until you see obvious evidence of the supernatural (and
perhaps not even then), a cult member may seem like just another patient
to you. Of course, since cults are often violent, you will likely be
working with Security and using restraints. Remember to stay safe,
because if you're dead, you can't do your job.
