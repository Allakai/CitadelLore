These topics pertain to the server's rules; mostly things that are too
complicated and specific to a niche scenario to be worth elaborating in
the rules page without needlessly burdening most users.

Basically, aside from the actual [rules](rules "wikilink") page, you
shouldn't need to know about any of this unless you're in a very
particular situation.
