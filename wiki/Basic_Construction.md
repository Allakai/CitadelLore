If you want to do any job like station engineer you need to know how to
build and demolish stuff.

For a full list of things you can construct and take apart, see the
[Guide to Construction](/wiki/Guide_to_Construction "wikilink").

What you'll need
----------------

### Basic Tools

Before you can begin any construction or de-construction you need to
gather a few useful tools.

These tools can be found in any blue mechanical toolbox on the station.

**Additional Uses:** Opening unpowered doors, bashing heads in

**Additional Uses:** Opening panels, poking eyes

**Additional Uses:** Welding doors, burning people, breaking glass.

You will need a welding mask if you plan to do more than a little
welding, also remember to turn off before you refill.

**Additional Uses:** Cutting people, wires and grills.

**Additional Uses:** Securing gas tanks, killing spys, fitting pipes,
etc.

### Materials

To build anything you need materials, the two main materials are
[Metal](/wiki/Construction_Materials#Metal "wikilink")
![](Metal.png "fig:Metal.png") and
[Glass](/wiki/Construction_Materials#Glass "wikilink")
![](Glass.png "fig:Glass.png"), these can be found around the station,
ordered from the [Quartermaster](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink") or salvaged
from parts of the station itself. If [botanists](botanist "wikilink")
are growing tower caps, you will have planks
![](Planks.png "fig:Planks.png") to build with.

Once you have your tools and material you can starting building.

Walls
-----

This is the standard type of wall found around the station, they are
easy to construct and remove but are not as strong as reinforced walls.
They also come in the hidden variety.

Reinforced Walls
----------------

This is the reinforced type of wall found in secure areas of station,
they are reasonably simple to construct, but are very time consuming to
remove. They also come in the hidden variety.

Windows
-------

Windows come in 2 types: Full and One Direction. Full is basically a
weaker, see-through and shoot-through wall, while one direction allows
the square it is on to be entered from any direction, except the
direction it's facing.

Grilles
-------

Grilles are usually used in combination with directional windows. They
allow gases and energy rounds to pass through them, but stop other
objects. They can also be electrified for high security areas.

Wiring
------

You cannot construct wires. They are only available right now from
yellow tool boxes, or scattered about the station's construction and
storage areas.

-   All wires are electrified if connected to a power net (a charged
    SMES battery is attached to the wire), and you will get fried if you
    touch them.
-   [Insulated gloves](/wiki/Insulated_gloves "wikilink") negate any
    electrical shocks to the player.

Let's say you have the following situation to fix:

### How do I wire?

Wires are directionally dependent on where you set them down, and will
apply adjacently to each "tile" you are standing by. Wires will always
face inwards to you, sort of like this:

![](Wire_laying1.PNG "Wire_laying1.PNG")

This image was made by standing in the center tile with a wire coil in
hand and clicking on all 8 surrounding tiles.

In situations where you can't place a wire like this you have an
alternative way. Just stand on a tile, face the direction you want it to
go (ctrl+arrow key) and click the tile you're standing on.

![](Wire_laying2.PNG "Wire_laying2.PNG")

This image was made by standing on the tile, pressing ctrl + left arrow
key and then clicking the tile. The cable coil was in my active hand.

### Dot wiring

Let's say you have a situation that you need to fix:

![](Wiring_situation.png "Wiring_situation.png")

The easiest method of wiring is dot-wiring. Also known as unsmooth or
non-smooth wiring.

Fixing this is simple:

![](wire_1_1.PNG "fig:wire_1_1.PNG") -&gt;
![](wire_1_2.PNG "fig:wire_1_2.PNG") -&gt;
![](wire_1_3.PNG "fig:wire_1_3.PNG"). Done.

You just position yourself properly and click the tile to lay down wire.
Make sure you click on the plating (floor) and not the already laid
wire. This is because:

![](wire_2_1.PNG "fig:wire_2_1.PNG") +
![](wire_2_2.PNG "fig:wire_2_2.PNG") =
![](wire_2_3.PNG "fig:wire_2_3.PNG")

This might look about the same as in the previous image, however it's
not. In the previous image your ending result had three pieces of wire,
one going from the east to the center, one going from the north to the
center and one going from the west to the center. In this situation you
have two pieces of wire. One going east to west and one going north to
center. The two wires don't meet in the center, because the horizontal
wire is going east-west without it having a point (or dot) in the
center.

### Smooth Wiring

Just click on wires that are "knotted" at on end (you just need to click
on the wire, not the little knotted dot). Smooth wires do not power
other wires on their same tile. So make sure to apply to the source
wire, or the connective tip.

To fix this situation with smooth wire you'll have to follow the steps:

![](Wire_1_1.PNG "fig:Wire_1_1.PNG") -&gt;
![](Wire_3_2.PNG "fig:Wire_3_2.PNG") -&gt;
![](Wire_3_3.PNG "fig:Wire_3_3.PNG") -&gt;
![](Wire_3_4.PNG "fig:Wire_3_4.PNG"). Done.

In this method you first lay one cable to go from one of the directions
to the center (image 1). You then position yourself in another direction
and click on the already laid wire piece (and not the floor!). This will
make the already placed piece and the new piece combine into one smooth
piece of wire (image 2). You then place another piece to go from the
last remaining direction to the center (image 3) and click it from the
last direction to make a 2nd smooth piece of wire (image 4).

This method often uses up more wire than dot-wiring, but it's prettier
and usually preferred.

### Cut the Wire

Use wire cutters to trim wires! Simple as that.

-   Wear insulated gloves if you value your life.

### Wire-net reset

This is byond's attempt to "reset" the whole power net in order to deal
with new/ removed wires that shift the power value of a whole system. It
will cause APCs to stop charging for a moment, and in huge nets it can
shut down the charging of all APCs for a while.

-   Don't mess with wires unless you have to, it causes problems to
    everyone in both OOC (due to potential lag) and IC (power loss).

Pipes
-----

### How do I get pipes?

Pipes are only constructed from pipe dispensers in atmospherics. To use
a pipe dispenser, follow these steps:

1.  Put dispenser in a powered area.
2.  Wrench Dispenser to lock it into place.
3.  Click on the pipe dispenser with an empty hand and select the pipes
    you wish to use.
4.  You have a pipe to play with now.
5.  Wrench dispenser to make it mobile once more.

### Placing and removing pipes

#### Disposal

1.  Rotate the pipe to the direction you wish the pipe to be in.
2.  Use a lit welder to fuse the pipe to the ground.

#### Gas pipes

1.  Rotate the pipe to the direction you wish (pay attention to gas
    pumps as they are direction dependent).
2.  Wrench into place.
3.  Turn on the pipe if necessary.

#### How to remove a pipe

1.  Perform the step you used to set the pipe into place in reverse
    (make sure the pipe is powered off).
2.  Brace for any junk that might blast out of the pipe.
