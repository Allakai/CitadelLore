'''Space suits''' are split into two categories: '''Voidsuits''' and the more advanced '''[[Hardsuit]]s'''. Voidsuits can protect you from a lack of pressure, temperature extremes (all suits protect up to 5000 Kelvin), radiation, and perhaps a few other dangers depending on the suit. Not wearing one of these out in space will almost definitely lead to your demise. There are several models designed for different departments, usually showing off the department colors if it isn't obvious. The [[Guide to EVA]] may be a good page to visit.

Most voidsuits have taur variants, which will only fit crew with a taur lower body. Note that '''refitting a taur-specific voidsuit will probably break it entirely.'''

=Voidsuits=
Below are voidsuits that can be found at the start of each shift, as well as some additional basic info about each of them.

==[[File:Grey_space_suit.png|64px]]Space Suit==
Perhaps the most basic of all of the suits about to be mentioned here, this suit offers all you need to go out into space. Nothing more, nothing less. Actually this isn't even a voidsuit, '''I lied'''. Found in EVA and Expedition Prep.

==[[File:Engineer_Hardsuit.png|64px]]Engineering==
Probably the most iconic suit, this engineering voidsuit has decent radiation protection, though not complete immunity. Found in Engineering EVA. Used by [[Station Engineer|engineers]].

==[[File:Atmospherics_Hardsuit.png|64px]]Atmospherics==
A suit similar to the engineering hardsuit, but it can withstand an incredible 30000 Kelvin atmosphere, provided the user isn't on fire. Found in EVA, Engineering EVA, and Atmospherics. Used by [[Atmospheric Technician|atmos techs]].

==[[File:Mining_Hardsuit.png|64px]]Mining==
A hardy suit for hardy labor, providing protection against melee and explosions. Found in Mining. Used by [[Shaft Miner|miners]].

==[[File:Medical_Hardsuit.png|64px]]Medical==
A white and blue suit for when medical inevitably gets breached by debris or something, nothing really notable about it. Found in EVA. Used by [[Medical Doctor|medbay staff]].

==[[File:EMT_Voidsuit.png|64px]]EMT==
A blue and yellow voidsuit with the medical cross on it, denoting that the user is either an [[Paramedic|EMT or Paramedic]], same as the medical voidsuit. Found in the EMT Bay. Used by [[Paramedic|EMTs]].

==[[File:Security_Hardsuit.png|64px]]Security==
A bright red suit that pretty much screams "hey I'm security," provides good melee and explosive protection. Found in EVA. Used by [[Security Officer|officers]].

==[[File:Experimental_Voidsuit.png|64px]]Experimental==
A voidsuit in the [[Head of Security]]'s possession (in their locker even), this is... exactly the same as a regular security voidsuit. Found in the HoS Office. Used by the [[Head of Security]].

==[[File:Skrell_Voidsuit.png|64px]]Skrell==
A voidsuit fitted for [[Skrell]] users, providing good energy and explosive resistance. Actually these aren't even voidsuits. Found in EVA. Used by [[Skrell]] crew. <s>Why are these here again?</s>

=Alternate Suits=
These voidsuits aren't normally found on station, and are acquired through [[Supply Crates|cargo]]. These suits aren't necessarily ''better'' but rather flip some stats around, making them situational.

==[[File:Reinforced_Voidsuit.png|64px]]Reinforced Engineering==
A much bulkier engineering voidsuit, mostly used if you plan on deflecting meteors with your fists. Also immune to radiation. Used by [[Station Engineer|engineers]].

==[[File:Heavy_Voidsuit.png|64px]]Heavy Duty Atmospherics==
A heavier variant of the regular atmospherics voidsuit, mostly used if you want to dive head first into a phoron fire. Used by [[Atmospheric Technician|atmos techs]].

==[[File:Construction_Voidsuit.png|64px]]Construction==
A bright orange and yellow suit, basically a bulky space-proof hazard vest. Used by [[Station Engineer|engineers]].

==[[File:Hazmat_Voidsuit.png|64px]]Hazmat==
A bulky yellow modification of the engineering voidsuit with a simple black finish to it, grants immunity to radiation. Used by [[Station Engineer|engineers]].

==[[File:Frontier_Voidsuit.png|64px]]Frontier==
A heavily plated voidsuit with a neat mohawk that ''apparently'' trades radiation resistance for bullet defense. Used by [[Shaft Miner|miners]].

==[[File:Biohazard_Voidsuit.png|64px]]Biohazard==
A booger green and white voidsuit that's about the same as the other medical voidsuits, just with more radiation and melee protection at the cost of explosive resistance. Used by [[Medical Doctor|virologists]].

==[[File:VMVoidsuit.png|64px]]Vey-Med Streamlined==
A streamlined, lightweight voidsuit that trades protection for seamless movement. Used by [[Paramedic|EMTs]].

==[[File:Riot_Voidsuit.png|64px]]Riot==
A sleek suit with a bit of a goofy helmet, but it provides very good melee resistance. Used by [[Security Officer|officers]].

==[[File:Crowd_Voidsuit.png|64px]]Crowd Control==
A black and intimidating voidsuit used in containing large crowds of filthy rubberneckers. Used by [[Security Officer|officers]].

=Other=
Out of reach of cargo and otherwise hard to obtain suits may actually end up on the VORE.

==[[File:NASA_Suit.gif|64px]]Basic Voidsuit==
A clunky red suit that's about the same as the first entry but with the same temperature resistances as the other voidsuits.

==[[File:Gem_Voidsuit.png|64px]]Gem==
This odd suit is encrusted with jewels and gems, almost like it belongs to a wizard of some sort. Found in the Vault.

==[[File:Mercenary_Voidsuit.png|64px]]Mercenary==
A blood red voidsuit with freakish green lighting, fit for combat scenarios <s>like raiding a station full of hungry and diverse crew, for instance!</s>
