The pilot is responsible for flying the excursion shuttle (and any other
shuttles that require a manual pilot). They are generally better trained
to operate the shuttle than others, and may have benefits in terms of
shuttle travel speed and failure rates when piloting. The pilot reports
to the Head of Personnel and is considered a member of the Civilian
staff of the station.

Set Up
------

There is no equipment that a pilot particularly needs over other
equipment. Should they wish to depart the shuttle while away, they will
need appropriate vacuum or atmosphere rated equipment to don before
disembarking. Otherwise, having a toolbox for field repairs and a radio
are suggested.

The shuttle will not take off during the first 30 minutes of the shift,
in order to give potential expedition members time to join and gear up
without someone blasting off out the hatch without them.

Muh Spaceship
-------------

While a pilot is on a shuttle, they are responsible for the crew on
board. All passengers **must** listen and follow pilot instructions with
regards to their shuttle. This only applies while the pilot has assumed
responsibility for the shuttle, of course, not while they are off-duty.

The pilot's main responsibility is being available to fly a shuttle
should an
[expedition](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure#Scientific_Expeditions "wikilink")
begin, and to remain able to fly the shuttle if the expedition needs to
return to the station. This does mean that the pilot should stay in
relatively safe areas while the expedition is ongoing, preferably near
their ship where they can monitor the equipment and conditions at the
landing site for changing weather. If the site is confirmed non-hostile,
they may disembark and explore, but should remain available for their
piloting duties.

It is within a pilot's right to evict people from their shuttle, though
overt discrimination is <s>usually</s> against company policy and can be
reported to Central Command. The pilot can even demand that a [Colony
Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink") leave their shuttle, and this is a
fully legal order (however, the Captain/Director can just immediately
fire them, removing their authority, if necessary).

Note: Using the right of eviction to assist people evading security is
sedition.

Piloting
--------

Piloting a shuttle along a network of destinations is fairly simple:

-   Ensure all normal doors are closed, bolted, and secured, with the
    exception of the airlock, which may be open if it detects a
    habitable atmosphere or docking area.
-   Undock the shuttle. This should cause any remaining airlocks to
    seal. Perform a final inspection and roll-call.
-   Select a destination in the computer, and begin piloting to the
    destination using the console. ((In-universe, this requires actual
    piloting finesse, it's not all automated))
-   Proceed along the destination paths until you arrive at a point
    where your passengers will be disembarking. Allow them to disembark,
    but monitor their use of the airlocks and doors to ensure safety.
-   Maintain a position inside the shuttle until the exterior has been
    confirmed as being safe, and make sure to remain available in the
    case of a need for a hasty departure.
