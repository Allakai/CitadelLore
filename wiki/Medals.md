[NanoTrasen](/wiki/NanoTrasen "wikilink") offers a variety of decorations to
crew members who do great things in service to the company. Some medals
are awarded by the [Colony Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink"), while
the highest honors are only given by NanoTrasen's administrators. Here
are all of the medals currently in service, listed below in order of
prestige in order of highest to lowest from top to bottom. This page
also lists notable recipients of various medals who have worked aboard
the [Virgo Orbital Research
Establishment](/wiki/Virgo_Orbital_Research_Establishment "wikilink"). Some
medal recipients were given under specific conditions that are worth
mentioning, while others are self-explanatory.

Distinguished Banner of Supreme Ineptitude
------------------------------------------

This "medal" can be made by ripping off some cardboard and using a scrap
of string from your uniform. It's given as a cruel joke by the crew
sometimes as a way of saying, "Well, you tried! But you still failed."
(If you end up on this list, relax, and just laugh along with us because
we were all idiot noobs once. <s>Else we'll make sure you never live it
down.</s>)

The actual reason this is rewarded is when you fail so spectacularly
that people don't even care you failed. It's downright *impressive* how
badly you failed.

**Notable recipients:**

-   Koshi Yoshimanatori (posthumously), for opening a door into a
    [phoron](phoron "wikilink") fire in an effort to rescue people
    inside, thus burning down most of the [Science](/wiki/Science "wikilink")
    Department and killing himself in the process.
-   Mederic Chesnais, for joining an assault on a nest of [giant fucking
    spiders](spiders "wikilink") against the orders of his Captain, with
    no knowledge of weaponry, wielding only a double-barrel shotgun, a
    kitchen knife, and a chef's apron, while everyone else came with
    heavily armed mechs. Very nearly died from multiple venomous bites.
-   <s>Sam Michels, for managing to light the <i>entire</i> planet on
    fire.</s> Nanotrasen denies that this ever occurred, and is simply a
    dream some crew members had.
-   Bites-The-Dust, for pretending he knew how to operate a supermatter
    engine. When asked about the unusual noise emanating from said
    engine, the engineer was quoted saying "The thumping means its
    working" shortly before before dousing the station in atomic fire.
