Welcome to the help page. Here's a bunch of information for you! See
[The Basics](/wiki/The_Basics "wikilink") if you're new.

Tutorial
--------

A basic, starter tutorial can be found on the [this
page](/wiki/The_Basics "wikilink"). Additional guides can be found
[here](/wiki/Guides "wikilink").

Tips on roleplay can be found in [A Crash Course In
Roleplaying](/wiki/A_Crash_Course_In_Roleplaying "wikilink")

Controls
--------

-   To move, use the **arrow keys**.
-   To speak in game, type **say "text"** OR Click on the chat button on
    the bottom right. Once you do this, you will automatically have
    **say "** as your starting text on your command text line.
-   To speak on standard radio channels type **say ";text"**. To speak
    on your department channel, use **say ":h text"**.
-   To speak in OOC chat type **ooc "text"**. You can ask questions
    about game mechanics in out of character (ooc) command or use the
    adminhelp command. **Please** do not state any information about
    anything IC related in OOC!
-   Instead of asking over OOC, it's sometimes better to ask question
    IC, such as "If someone should be doing something" in game. As in
    saying in your radio ";Should the security officer have a revolver?"
-   **Left clicking** an object make you interact with your hand, or
    whatever object may be holding in it. Usually this will let you pick
    up items. You can drop items by using the drop option in the tool
    bar, or throw option (followed by a click on screen for the
    direction and distance).
-   **Right clicking** will bring up options for the tile you selected,
    such as an item list and options on how to interact with an object.
-   You have a number of equipment slots you can change about with
    different items, and two hand slots.
-   Of all the option slots, the ones you should pay attention to are
    the "Run/Walk" tool bar option (which allows you to slow your
    character down so they don't slip on wet floors or walk more
    carefully), and the "Intent" button (which changes how your hand and
    weapons interact with people).

Most objects can be interacted with in the game world by clicking on
them, double clicking them, or right-clicking them.

### More Controls

To take items off a person, click the persons sprite with the left mouse
button and drag their sprite onto yours.

When you have done that, a popup window should come up and by simply
pressing the names of the items you want to take off they will be
removed from the person you are striping and appear on the floor
underneath them.

With the mouse you can perform the following actions:

-   Pick things up (one left mouse click on the object when having a
    free hand selected).
-   Switch hands (one left mouse click on the button that has a picture
    of two hands).
-   Drop what you are holding in the selected hand (one left mouse click
    on the button that says "Drop")
-   Attack (one left mouse click to attack once with the object you are
    holding in the selected hand).
-   Pull (right click on the item, in the drop down box select the item
    and click "pull", to let go of what you are pulling, click the
    button in the very bottom right corner, the person standing next to
    a box).
-   Use potatoes and objects (one left mouse click when having a free
    hand selected).
-   Examine what is on the tile your mouse is on (right click on the
    item, in the drop down box select the item and click "examine").
-   Grab (one left mouse click on the person while having "intent" set
    on "grab").
-   Use objects on people (one left mouse click on the person while
    having the object in the selected hand, same as "attack").
-   Help/Perform CPR (one left mouse click on the person while having
    intent set on "help").
-   You can press Shift+(Arrow Key) to change the direction you're
    facing.
-   See the [Commands](/wiki/Commands "wikilink") page, for more commands.

Starting Tips
-------------

**Some general tips that will get you through game play:**

-   **READ THE [RULES](/wiki/Rules "wikilink").**
-   To set internals, put an air or gas mask on your mask equipment
    slot, then take an air tank in hand and click it to open an options
    menu. You should leave the pressure output to default for air mix
    tanks, and you can change pure oxygen tanks as low as 17 pressure.
    Large tanks can hooked to your back, emergency tanks can hooked to
    your belt and in your pocket (both ways, once the tank is open,
    allow your hands to be free). You need internals if the
    environmental air is gone or poisoned.
-   Start out as an [Assistant](/wiki/Assistant "wikilink") the first time you
    play. They are not really expected to do anything so you can explore
    all you want.
-   If someone kills you in game, do not complain about it over the Out
    of Character channel - This is the most egregious case of IC in OOC!
    If this occurs, you can adminhelp using F1 and explain the full
    situation.
-   Please try not to let people know exactly what you are doing in game
    in OOC; "How do I fire a revolver". You can reword that and say,
    "I've heard a lot about revolvers here and there but not enough, how
    do they work?"
-   Do not complain to an admin if you got caught during a crime,
    especially if you weren't a traitor. Read [Corporate
    Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") to know what not to
    do in character.
-   Leave criminal catching to [Security](/wiki/Security "wikilink"). If there
    is no security, or your life is in danger, try to just disarm or run
    away first! Killing is only an option if the person is persistently
    trying to kill you and you have no other way to stop them.
-   Try to listen to [Security](/wiki/Security "wikilink"). They're trying to
    keep the station safe. Most of the time.
-   Breaches and space are deadly without a [space
    suit](space_suit "wikilink") on, and a set of internals running -
    Moreso than on other servers. Lifting environmental locks can be
    **extremely hazardous** and a player should strive not to breach an
    area.

### [Traitor](/wiki/Traitor "wikilink")

Try to resist the urge to press the "Be Syndicate" button. Traitor has
incredibly high expectation on Vorestation compared to other servers,
and diving in the deep end can end tragically. Get a feel for how
everything works, and hope you get brainwashed in a Revolution or
Cultist round to have a watered down traitor experience, before taking
the plunge. Remember: The ultimate goal is not to win, but to make the
game fun for everyone as an antagonist here.

Other Tips
----------

Helpful hints and tips that don't really fit anywhere else. These are
those small details which most people get through playing, but are here
for players new and old to learn.

Checking out the [Backstory](/wiki/Backstory "wikilink"),
[Terminology](Terminology "wikilink") and [Guides](/wiki/Guides "wikilink") is
also recommended.

### Controls

-   By dragging the sprite of a container, for example a box or a
    character sprite onto your own characters sprite when next to them
    you will open a window with it's contents. This allows you take
    items without picking up the container, or to access a characters
    inventory (you also set [Internals](/wiki/Internals "wikilink") there).
    Containers that dispose it's contents by simply clicking, like the
    donut box or the paper bin can be picked up with that method.
-   You can give an item to someone quickly by right-clicking them and
    selecting the give option while adjacent to them. This won't work if
    their hands are full.
-   **say ":b"** is Cyborg talk; only the AI and other Cyborgs can hear
    this.
-   Almost every department has their own radio channel. Each can only
    be heard by the appropriate headset, or by someone standing adjacent
    to them. Examine your headset to find out what it is.
-   You can use the .ping command to measure the round trip ping-pong
    between you and the server.
-   If you want to use a command many times quickly for some reason
    (such as .ping), or your headset did not broadcast your message over
    its special channel, you can recall the text you have previously
    entered by holding control and pressing the up-arrow key.
-   When pulling an object, such as a locker, fuel tank or something
    else you can walk over, click a floor tile with an empty hand to
    push the object to the desired tile.
-   Press the drop button to drop someone while grabbing them.
-   Press the pull button (icon that has a man and a box) to stop
    dragging an object.
-   Drag a characters sprite onto yourself to open a window where you
    can forcibly take off or put items on their person after a delay.
    Both of you must be adjacent to each other during this time for it
    to be successful.
-   Click yourself with food or drink in hand to eat/drink.

### General

-   Remember when using [Internals](/wiki/Internals "wikilink") that only
    *pure* oxygen should be set at around 17kPA. A tank of mixed air's
    distribution pressure should be set around 81kPa.
-   Clicking something on a table will set something down on it.
-   To use the Hand Labeler click it while it is in your hand, then
    write your text. This will produce a label, pick it up and click it
    to remove the backing, then you can stick it on whatever you choose-
    *Before setting it down,* doubleclick it to turn it off and avoid
    labeling the desk.
-   You can name a sheet of paper by right clicking it and choosing
    rename.
-   Labcoats and the detective's coat have pockets. You can store two
    small objects inside them (click with a free hand to open, click and
    drag to hand icon to take off). You can take off backpacks and belts
    in the same way.
-   You can buckle yourself or other people onto chairs/beds by dragging
    the character sprite onto the chair/bed that they are currently
    standing on. You unbuckle by clicking on it. You can unbuckle
    yourself as long as your aren't handcuffed.
-   To use a bed sheet, first pick the item up. Next, while it is in
    your hand, stand over the bed and click the "activate held item"
    button in your objects tab. This will make the bed sheet appear
    above you or the person you wished to cover.
-   When talking to/about someone, right click and examine the person to
    check their gender.
-   When being attacked, the number one thing you want to do is run and
    call for help. If this is not possible, clicking your attacker with
    the "Disarm" intent is your friend and will be the most helpful for
    you.
-   If someone is forcing something onto you (force feeding, taking off
    clothes, etc.) your best bet is to run away. If not possible,
    clicking resist can help.
-   You can remove handcuffs or straight jackets by clicking resist.
    This requires a couple of minutes and standing still. This also
    applies to being handcuffed and buckled to something.
-   Clicking on someone with the help intent will shake them. Use this
    on others and yourself to stand up faster from falling.
-   You can commit suicide if you target your mouth and click yourself
    with a gun, though this is not recommended in the slightest.
    **Remember suicide is against the rules: Log out via cryo if you
    have to leave!**
-   If you log out you will fall asleep. You will most likely be taken
    to the dormitories, so don't be surprised when you wake up. Unless
    you specify it in your flavortext or otherwise give permission, it's
    against the rules to eat you so ahelp if this happens.
-   While asleep, you can dream. It appears as blue text with random
    words.
-   Reinforced metal (plasteel) can be made by
    [Miners](/wiki/Miner "wikilink") by smelting plasma ore and iron ore in
    the smelter on the mining base.
-   You can weld and un-weld a locker/closet by using a welding tool.
-   Swipe your ID on a personal locker to claim it as your own. Only
    you, the HoP, or the Captain can open them once claimed.
-   Do not use a lit welding tool on a welding fuel tank. The results
    are explosive.
-   Wardrobes function like Plants Bags/Mining Satchels. Click it in
    your hand to drop all items to the floor. Click the items with the
    Wardrobe in hand to pick them all back up.

### Security

-   You can attach handcuffs to shoes to create shackles. You can have
    prisoners wear these to prevent them from running.
-   Keep a [stun baton](stun_baton "wikilink") as your \#1 choice of
    weapon against unarmed law offenders, use the taser only when you
    have to stun someone from distance to ensure he/she wont attack you
    as it has a much lower ammo reserve.

### Communication

-   If your headset stops working, it's likely the [Telecommunication
    Satellite](/wiki/Telecommunications "wikilink") is down. Station Bounced
    Radios and Intercoms will still work.
-   Electrical storms can change your radio messages to gibberish.

### Medical

-   The guide to [Surgery](/wiki/Surgery "wikilink") can help you fix a lot if
    issues if your character has the anatomy skill at
    trained/professional.
-   Your health indicator works off of pain, and you might have more or
    less damage than you actually see- Check with a doctor if you hurt!
-   Sleepers cannot heal toxin damage. Soporific will send the patient
    to sleep.
-   All damage you take will add to your 'shock' damage. When your
    'shock' damage gets high enough you will start to move slowly, only
    be able to whisper or stammer into your headset, be unable to see,
    and eventually collapse. Painkillers, such as tramadol are able to
    treat shock, but regular damage must still be treated normally.
-   The Body Scanner in Medbay can be used to tell where injuries,
    broken bones, and implants are located.
-   Diseases do not show up on your medical scanner. Appendicitis is the
    only condition that does.
-   Spaceacillin will slow most disease progression, but must be cured
    by [Virology](/wiki/Virology "wikilink").

### Kitchen and Bar

-   Chickens will lay eggs if fed wheat, and using a bucket on a cow can
    harvest milk.

### Code

-   Break the game and win a Certificate of Awesome!
-   Report bugs to the admins.
