Short for '''Personal Data Assistant''', PDAs are usually useful to their owners, as they have a variety of functions, such as note keeping and messaging, as well as job-specific functions like controlling [[Beepsky]] and [[Detective|analyzing fingerprints or blood stains]], sending [[quartermaster|deliveries]], analyzing the atmosphere around you, scanning for [[medical doctor|disease]] or [[scientist|components]], checking how much [[Station Engineer|power]] are in the APCs around the station and [[traitor|causing]] [[Syndicate Items|chaos]].

The PDAs message function rely's on the RD's message server. If it is powerless or broken then no one will be able to send messages to each other. The message server also logs your dirty little messages so don't expect to be able to get away with using them to rally a rebellion.

Your primary use of the PDA will likely be the handy flashlight feature it comes with. Once the station descends into chaos, you won't have to go hunting around for a flashlight, as you have a weak one built right in. Just put the PDA in your hand, click it, and click "enable flashlight." This light will also count for the stacking effect other flashlights have.

If you so desire you can eject the cartridge you have currently installed with the "eject cartridge button" at the top of the PDA's main menu interface, and use a new cartridge that you pilfered off someone else or spawned with a [[Syndicate Items|certain method]] into it. You will need to do this if you wish to install the [[Syndicate Items#Detomatix PDA Cartridge|Detomatix cartridge]], but remember to eject it when you are done, lest [[security]] catch you with it.

==Default Features==
* '''Messenger''': Send personal messages to any PDA with messaging enabled.
* '''Notekeeper''': Any notes you may wish to record may be stored here. Using your PDA on a piece of [[paper]] will scan it's contents and write it in your notekeeper, overwriting your current notes.
* '''Atmospheric Scan''': Use this to display the status of your environmental air-supply, works much like an [[analyzer]].
* '''Flashlight''': This low powered flashlight can be used to successfully navigate through areas without lighting.
* '''Crew Manifest ''': View the list of crew members and their status.
* '''News''': Access the depressing News channels right from your PDA!
