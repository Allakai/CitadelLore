As a **Bartender**, it's your job to keep any alcohol inclined crew
happy. That means serving drinks to anyone who comes by the
[Bar](/wiki/Bar "wikilink"). You might also consider some form of
entertainment, such as gambling or a variety show, to liven up the Bar.

Preparing the Bar
-----------------

The Bar is your palace.  
A good bartender should prepare it for his regular patrons, so that they
feel at home! Remember, the more comfortable they are, the more booze
they drink!  
It might be a good idea to set up the EFTPOS Scanner, and charge people
for their drinks. After all, if they want to drown their sorrows in
alcohol, losing a couple extra thalers won't hurt!  
It would also be wise to set your barsign to whatever you feel more
comfortable with. Just swipe your ID and pick the neon sign you want to
display!  
Also, why not display a [menu](/wiki/Example_Paperwork#Bar_menu "wikilink") of
all the possible drinks to make sure your patrons always have something
to drink!

Equipment
---------

-   **Armour vest**: Bars are known for bar room brawls. This'll help
    you stay upright in breaking up a fight.
-   **Shotgun**: Found on the table in the back room. This is for
    breaking up bar fights and self defense. Taking outside the bar area
    is a [criminal offence](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink") so use it
    carefully.
-   **Shaker**: Tied with large reagent beakers as the biggest reagent
    containers available in the station. It can fit 100 reagent units.
-   **Formal closet**: Containing 2 formal uniforms like the one you
    spawn with, 2 pairs of black shoes and 2 top hats. There is an
    additional top-hat on the bar counter.
-   **Booze-O-Mat**: Dispenses alcoholic drinks. If it runs out of
    points, ask the [Quartermaster](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink") for a Bar
    Charge.
-   **Beer locker, beer keg, beanbag shells and an empty freezer**: All
    inside the Refrigerator room, next to the formal locker.
-   **Pun Pun**: A monkey. Sort of decorative. People are mixed about
    their feelings to him.

Serving Drinks
--------------

You have a whole bunch of spirits in your handy Booze-o-mat vending
machine, with which to mix all manner of drinks. Serve up what the crew
wants, or just what you feel like mixing.

Traitoring
----------

Traitor Barman has it hard. You start with less access than everyone
except the [Librarian](/wiki/Librarian "wikilink") and beanbag rounds don't do
anything to people in armour (unless you aim for their legs). Your bar
suit stands out fantastically and if you're not in the bar when someone
inevitably shows up, expect them to call attention to your absence. If
you want to get anything at all done, empty the beer locker onto the bar
and hope that everyone gets too drunk to care.

You do however have a potentially lethal weapon nearby. You'll need to
put effort into getting enough metal and tools to hack the autolathe and
make lethal shells though (a buddy in the Cargo Bay might be useful
here).

The Maintenance tunnel east of the bar have
[shades](/wiki/Clothes_and_Internals#Eyewear "wikilink") and a [fire
suit](/wiki/Engineering_Items#Firesuit "wikilink"). Use of an emag and your
shotgun may help you for your objectives. It's best to stay around the
bar as much as you can, as you may look suspicious if people come by,
wanting a drink at the bar.
