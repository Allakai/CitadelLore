Congratulations on your employment by
[NanoTrasen](/wiki/NanoTrasen "wikilink"). Make sure to check out the other
[Guides](/wiki/Guides "wikilink") as well as the [Job
Guides](/wiki/Job_Guides "wikilink").

Space Station 13 is a multiplayer roleplaying game developed using the
[BYOND](http://www.byond.com/) engine. In Space Station 13 (from here on
to be referred to as SS13, players take the role of workers in a sci-fi
setting. There are many different [jobs](/wiki/Job_Guides "wikilink")
available, and each player chooses and plays a role in the space
station.

**V.O.R.E. is a heavy
[roleplay](/wiki/A_Crash_Course_in_Roleplaying "wikilink") server. The choice
is not optional; it is enforced. Should you be new to roleplaying,
consult [A Crash Course in
Roleplaying](/wiki/A_Crash_Course_in_Roleplaying "wikilink"). Should you still
have questions, poke any of the in-game admins.**

The Rules
---------

Yes, there are [rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink") set in place to ensure an
enjoyable experience for all players. Please take a moment and read
them. If you're extra worried, you can also read about how [not to get
banned.](/wiki/Not_Getting_Banned "wikilink")

Joining the Server
------------------

To join the server you'll need to follow a couple of steps:

1.  Download the BYOND client from
    [here](http://www.byond.com/download/). You'll need it to start
    playing
2.  Register for a BYOND account
    [here](https://secure.byond.com/?page=Join).
3.  Add the server address to your bookmarks, or just join manually
    using the BYOND client. Either way, connect to
    **byond://vore-station.net:2303**

If all has gone well, congratulations! You're on the server! Before you
can jump in and start playing, we strongly recommend you set up your
character first.

Character Setup
===============

General Tab
-----------

These often do not have any mechanical effect on gameplay, but are some
of the most critical aspects of the character.

### General

-   **Name:** As part of the [roleplay
    guidelines](/wiki/Rules#Roleplay "wikilink") followed by the server, it is
    required that all characters have a first and last name (with the
    exception of different languages or cultures, but use common
    sense!). By randomizing your name, the game will pick a suitable
    name for your character, accounting for gender.
-   **Gender:** Self-explanatory; this may or may not alter your sprite
    depending on your selected species' gender dimorphism.
-   **Gender Identity:** Alters the pronouns used to refer to you
    ingame.
-   **Age:** The only cosmetic setting that is basically useless. It
    will only appear on in-game security and medical records and won't
    change your character's appearance. The only other effect is has is
    the Skill System.
-   **Spawn point:** This selects where on the map your character will
    spawn in. If you are not familiar with the different locations, just
    leave the default setting.
-   **OOC Notes:** You **must** input your ERP preferences into this
    section so other players can read them and decide if your
    preferences align for ERP purposes.

### Languages

-   **Adding/Removing Languages:** You can add and remove any language
    you wish, except Galactic Common which is the default language for
    all characters. Depending on your species or whitelist status for
    restricted languages, you may see more or fewer choices.
-   **Language Keys:** When you wish to speak in another language, you
    must prefix the message with one of these keys, followed by a
    language-specific character, visible ingame in the "Check Known
    Languages" screen.

### Body

-   **Reset (R):** The small R in parenthesis will reset your body to a
    random state, clearing your custom settings.
-   **Species:** Here you will select the species which you wish to play
    as. Some species have mechanical advantages and disadvantages, but
    all of the commonly available, non-whitelisted species are fairly
    similar. Whitelisted species may have large mechanical differences.
-   **Blood type:** As in real-life, this determines your compatibility
    for transfusions from blood packs or to/from other characters. See
    [Blood Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type) for details.
-   **Needs glasses:** Whether or not your character needs prescription
    lenses to have full visual acuity. If you are saying "why would
    anyone want this? that's a disadvantage!" you should read up on
    roleplaying realistic characters.
-   **Limbs:** Here you can replace any of your limbs with cybernetic
    facsimiles or remove them altogether. Playing a cripple not capable
    of performing any job is generally not allowed. See the
    [Rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink"). Choosing **Full Body** in this menu will
    allow you to play an entirely synthetic character, who must recharge
    instead of eating, and has other small mechanics changes related to
    damage. See [Synthmorph](/wiki/Synthmorph "wikilink").
-   **Internal Organs:** You can modify the state of your internal
    organs here, namely whether or not they are mechanically assisted or
    cybernetic.
-   **Hair:** You can select a hairstyle here. For some species with
    ears, you should select their 'Speciesname'-style hairstyles to keep
    the ears as the ears are actually part if the hair sprites.
-   **Facial:** For facial hair selection, similar to hair style
    selection.
-   **Eyes:** They may only be one pixel, but they're pretty obvious if
    you're not wearing glasses.
-   **Body Color:** The overall color of your body. Depending on the
    species, may take some playing with to get the color you want
    exactly right.
-   **Body Markings:** You can add and remove colorable body markings
    here to further customize your character. Please keep it reasonable,
    however.

### Equipment

Here you can select some undergarments for your character. Most of the
options are fairly self-explanatory. None of them confer any mechanical
change: they are purely cosmetic changes. Underwear and socks can be
removed ingame with the use of a verb in the IC tab.

### Background Information

Purely for roleplay purposes, these show up on your employment,
security, or medical records ingame for other players, so should be
populated to match the backstory for your character.

### Records

Security, medical, and employment records should each be populated with
appropriate information that might be in a real record for that
character. None of the records should contain any 'fantastic'
information that a normal HR, security, or medical person wouldn't
include. No backstory involving extra-ordinary crimes or mercenaries or
ninjas or other things is allowed without a Special Character
Application to the staff.

### Flavor

You are required to populate your flavor text with some information
about the visual appearance of your character. Without this, people will
only have an idea of what you look like based on the tiny sprite, and
that is not a lot to go on. These should contain things that people can
SEE, not thoughts the character has. 'Robot' flavor text is the flavor
text applied if you join as a Cyborg rather than any other job slot, and
is not used any other time.

Skills Tab
----------

This tab is purely to allow you to gauge what your character would be
able to know without becoming unrealistic. See the
[Rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink") about unrealistic characters. If you can't fit
all your characters skills into this screen, then you are beginning to
push the boundaries of having an unrealistic character. The amount of
skills you can have is based on age, species, and other factors.

Occupation Tab
--------------

This grid allows you to set job preferences. These preferences only take
effect when the game is automatically assigning jobs at the beginning of
a round, and have no effect if you are joining after a round has already
begun.

If you set your preferences here, it will attempt to assign you the
highest preference job, in competition with anyone else who has that
same preference set, and do the same for all other players, trying to
assign them each their most desirable job. You can also pick what
happens if none of your desired jobs are available, at the bottom of
this tab.

Antagonism Tab
--------------

Most of the options on this tab have no effect, as we do not play with
traditional randomly-assigned antagonist roles. Some settings still
influence things, however:

-   **Be positronic brain:** If someone selects a positronic brain and
    requests ingame that a ghost inhabit it, if you have this enabled,
    you will be asked if you wish to inhabit the brain and join the
    round.
-   **Be pAI candidate:** Similar to the above, but for inhabiting pAI
    devices.

Loadout Tab
-----------

Here you can select some equipment to start the round with, aside from
your default starting equipment. Some of the pieces of equipment on this
page may be restricted to certain jobs, and even if you select them, you
will not spawn with them if you do not join as that job.

You have a certain number of points to allocate on this screen, if you
wish. There's no requirement to use any of the points.

Global Tab
----------

This has some settings that apply to all of your characters, as they are
not really character-specific settings, but rather 'player' settings on
how your client should behave.

-   **UI Style:** You can select a style for the in-game user interface
    here, as well as the color and transparency level of the interface.
-   **Preferences:** There are many settings here, each which you might
    not understand until you have played the game to some extent. It's
    recommended you not alter any of them until you have played the game
    and understand what they mean.
-   **pAI:** When you are a pAI candidate and someone is searching for a
    ghost to inhabit their pAI, these fields will be displayed to them
    so they can make their choice.
-   **Communicator Identity:** These settings allow you to configure a
    communicator, if you begin the game with one. Traditionally the game
    starts you with a PDA to communicate with other players, however you
    may also take a handheld Communicator capable of voice and video
    calls. You can pick this in the Loadout tab.
-   **Jukebox Volume:** If you find the ingame jukebox music to be too
    loud, you can permanently alter the volume here.
-   **Media Player Type:** See the ingame description.

VORE Tab
--------

Here you can select from several nonstandard VOREStation-specific
character setup options.

-   **Ears:** You can select from a list of custom ear styles for
    various types of animals, as well as color some of them that are
    marked as colorable.
-   **Tail:** Similar to the ears choice, but for tails instead. This
    also includes various wings.
-   **Custom Species:** If you have selected the 'Tajara' species to
    represent something like a tiger or leopard rather than an actual
    Tajara, you can input your species here, and it will display this
    instead of 'Tajara' when you are examined. 'Tiger', 'Wolf', 'Silver
    Fox' are good examples.
-   **Scale:** This adjusts the character's scale to one of several
    pre-set sizes. Characters can pick up other characters in their
    hands and treat them like items if they are more than two sizes
    larger than the smaller character.
-   **Relative weight:** The starting weight for your character.
    Determines examine messages about your character's weight. The
    default is 137.
-   **Weight Gain Rate:** The rate at which your character gains weight
    from eating.
-   **Weight Loss Rate:** The loss rate of the same.
-   **Egg Type:** Changes the sprite used if you are converted into an
    'egg' via the 'egg' vore methods by a predator.
-   **Start With Body Scan:** Determines whether the medical department
    (or robotics, for synthmorphs) starts with a scan of your body. In
    practice, this determines whether or not they will be able to revive
    you in your original body if you die during the round. **This is NOT
    the only step that needs to be taken if you wish to be revived
    during the round.** If resleeving is in use (the current default on
    the map), then you must also go to medical for a mind-backup implant
    so that medical has copies of both your body and mind.
-   **Prevent Body Impersonation:** The nature of resleeving allows
    medical (or robotics) to insert minds into bodies they were not
    originally occupying. Setting this to 'Yes' prevents anyone but your
    own mind being put into copies of your body, if this sort of thing
    bothers you OOCly. This does not prevent someone from making an
    'extremely similar looking' body and putting a mind in it, however
    that will not have your name.
-   **Round-To-Round Persistence:** You can select several settings that
    will be saved when you leave the round, if you wish, to further
    enhance the between-rounds continuity of your character. These are
    all character setup options and if you ended the round in a state
    that you didn't wish to be in, but had persistence enabled, you can
    just edit the relevant changes out of your character in the
    character setup screen.
-   **Event Volunteer:** Has no mechanical use, however admins can query
    for a list of people with this enabled if they are looking for
    volunteers to play roles in an event for the server.
-   **Event Pref:** When you are not picked as a volunteer, you can
    select here how you wish the event characters interact with you, be
    that no interaction, or if they are allowed to kidnap you, etc.

The User Interface
==================

This is a general guide to the game interface; note that it won't be
accurate to all UI styles, nor are all the elements shown in the image
at right.

Equipment
---------

<img src="Tut-Equipment.png" title="fig:Equipment Area" alt="Equipment Area" width="400" />
There are several slots on which you can equip items that represent
different parts of your body.

-   **1:** Head slot, mostly for helmets and hats.
-   **2:** Ear slots, for headsets and other very small objects that
    could be put behind an ear (pens, etc).
-   **3:** Eye slot, for glasses and goggles.
-   **4:** Face slot, for masks mostly.
-   **5:** Uniform slot, the base clothing layer that most people will
    have equipped.
-   **6:** Suit/Exosuit slot, for clothing worn over your uniform,
    including spacesuits.
-   **7:** Gloves sl

ot, for various gloves.

-   **8:** Shoes slot, for various shoes, boots, and sandals.
-   **I:** ID slot, holds an ID card, wallet, or PDA. Doors check the
    access in your hands first, then this slot.
-   **B:** Belt slot, you can also put some smaller items here to clip
    them onto a waistband.
-   **P:** backPack slot, where a bag is usually stored, though can also
    hold O2 tanks, jetpacks, and hardsuit modules.
-   **Hands:** You usually have two of them, and can swap between them.
    The active one has a lit border. You will 'use' this hand when you
    click on things in the world.
-   **Pockets:** Only usable if you have a uniform equipped, these
    pockets can hold one small item each.

Modes
-----

<figure>
<img src="Tut-Modes.png" title="Modes Area" alt="Modes Area" width="400" /><figcaption>Modes Area</figcaption>
</figure>

-   **M:** Movement speed toggle, switch between running and walking.
    Walking allows you to cross slippery areas without tripping.
-   **I:** [Intent](/wiki/Intent "wikilink") setting. This selects how you
    will interact with an object or a person when you make an action.
    Blue is **Disarm**, green is **Help**, yellow is **Grab**, and red
    is **Harm**.
-   **T:** Targeting diagram. You can click body parts here to select
    what body part to affect when clicking other characters. For example
    if you have the head selected and click someone with a crowbar in
    your hand, you will hit them in the head with the crowbar.
-   **G:** Gun settings. Toggles between either immediately firing a gun
    each click, or aiming and notifying the player that they are
    targeted. You can then select options to automatically fire in
    certain conditions such as if they move.

Status
------

<figure>
<img src="Tut-Status.png" title="Status Area" alt="Status Area" width="400" /><figcaption>Status Area</figcaption>
</figure>

-   **W:** Warnings will be displayed here about temperature or pressure
    problems you're experiencing, such as being exposed to fire, vacuum,
    or toxic atmospheres.
-   **I:** A button that represents whether or not you are breathing
    through your air mask (or hardsuit) if one is worn. Click to toggle.
-   **D:** A dummy of your body is here to show where you are feeling
    pain. It will usually be green, with darker and darker red
    highlights to indicate more pain. If grey, you are unable to feel
    pain due to being a synthmorph, or for other reasons.
-   **H:** A hunger indicator is displayed here which will show darker
    and darker shades of red as your character becomes more and more
    hungry. This represents charge level for synthmorphs.

Interacting With the World
--------------------------

Interacting with your surroundings in Space Station 13 is mostly done by
the mouse. You can click with an empty hand active to pick up items or
open containers, click on something with an item in your active hand to
use the item on it, click on a computer or device to view its display,
and so on. Once you get the hang of managing your character's hands,
things will make more sense: you can't, for example, open a toolbox in
your left hand if your right hand is full.

A good way of interpreting the interaction system in Space Station 13 is
to think of each click as 'using' the object (or hand) on whatever
you're clicking on. For instance, to use a computer in real life, you'd
essentially 'use' an empty hand on it to start typing. Using an empty
hand on an object will pick it up, if you can hold it. Holding an item
in your hand and clicking on something can result in three things:

-   If the object in hand is meant to be used with the object you're
    clicking on, the desired effect should occur. In the case of
    containers, such as drink bottles or beakers, you'll transfer a
    certain amount of fluid units (usually 10) of the liquid from the
    container in your hand, to the container you're clicking on. For
    things like crowbar'ing the floor, you'll pry off a floor tile.
-   If the object in hand is not meant to be used with the object you're
    clicking on, more often than not (and very annoyingly, sometimes)
    you'll attack the target with the object. This can result in rather
    funny cases of hitting people with first aid kits, hitting your
    drinks machine with a bottle of vodka, etc. Or more dangerously,
    hitting someone with a crowbar, scalpel, toolbox, etc. This happens
    to be the essence of Robusting, as well (which we do not recommend
    you to try on unsuspecting crewmembers for no reason), which is
    basically clicking on someone, but with a weapon or very damaging
    object in hand.
-   If what you're clicking on is something that stores objects, the
    object will be taken out of your hand and placed in or on the
    target. This can be something like a table, opened locker or crate,
    which will place the object on top of the target, such that drinks
    will be placed on tables and jumpsuits will be placed in
    (technically, on) lockers. Objects like boxes and
    backpacks/satchels, which can be opened to reveal more slots for
    storing objects, will remove the item from your hand when clicked
    on, placing it in a slot inside.

Several interactions also use mouse drags to interact. For example, if
you are standing adjacent to a cardboard box, dragging the sprite of the
box onto your character's sprite will open the box and display the
contents. Dragging your backpack that you are wearing to one of your
hand slots will remove the backpack and put it in that hand. That's
important because clicking your worn backpack just opens it and displays
the contents, so this is one of the only ways to remove backpacks.

It's okay to memorize those, but playing jobs that involve more object
handling, such as Chef, Barman or Cargo Tech, will really help you
understand how the system interprets clicks, and what to expect when
trying to use something.

Interacting with Other People
-----------------------------

Vorestation is a roleplay-heavy server, and so your interactions with
those around you are going to be very, very important. You won't get
very far with pointing-and-clicking alone, so there are several basic
commands to remember when dealing with other characters on the station:

-   **`Say`:**, Speak to those in sight. You can prefix your message a
    semicolon (`;`) to talk on the general radio channel, if you have a
    headset, or a colon and a letter (i.e. `:m` or `:s`) to talk on your
    department radio channel. (You can examine headsets to see which
    channels they can access.)
-   **`Whisper`:** Speak quietly, only audible to those right next to
    you. Anyone farther away will be told that you're whispering
    something.
-   **`Me`:** Lets you narrate your character's actions in an emote.
    This will have your character's make in front of the text.
-   **`Subtle`:** Lets you narrate something your character is doing
    subtly and would not be obvious to those further away. 'Subtle' is
    to 'Me', as 'Whisper' is to 'Say'.
-   **`OOC`:** Speak to everyone currently playing, in an
    Out-Of-Character way. This can be used to ask about game mechanics
    and other things not concerning the game. Do not send lots of
    messages via this. If you have a lot to discuss, join one of the
    out-of-game communication methods (forums, Discord, etc).
-   **`LOOC`:** Speak to everyone within your view in an
    Out-Of-Character way. This can be used to ask other players to
    explain procedures or ask for help without having to broadcast your
    request to the entire server. Also used for negotiating ERP
    preferences with those that you're playing with.

Don't be afraid to be creative! Writing speech with an accent, or being
descriptive with your emotes, will make you a lot more memorable.

For example:

> `Say ":n Dr. Glass, could you come to Xenobiology, please? I think you should see this...`  
>   
> `Whisper "Don' bloody move, yeah, or you're a dead man.`  
>   
> `Me "grumbles irritably and kicks his feet up on his desk, glowering at his boss.`

And don't forget to type properly! Consistently making typos or
forgetting punctuation looks about the same to other players as showing
up to a job interview drunk and slurring.

Here's a quick list of the different radio keys: (NOTE: YOUR HEADSET
MUST HAVE THE CHANNELS TO USE THEM. EXAMINE THE HEADSET TO DETERMINE IF
THEY DO)

-   **:h** Will send your message to your department radio directly.
-   **:c** Will send the message to the Command Channel
-   **:s** Will send the message to the Security Channel
-   **:m** Will send the message to the Medical Channel
-   **:e** Will send the message to the Engineering Channel
-   **:n** Will send the message to the Research Channel
-   **:u** Will send the message to the Supply Channel
-   **:v** Will send the message to the Service Channel
-   **:i** Will let you talk into any adjacent intercom
      
    **y** will send a message to the Explorers Channel

If you wish to emote something over coms then use " say;! \[...\] ".

What To Do Now
==============

There's a couple of things to do to help you settle in at Vorestation
once you've gotten the hang of the game:

-   **Read up on some other [Guides](/wiki/Guides "wikilink"):** You can never
    know too much.

<!-- -->

-   **Try advanced jobs:** Once you feel you have the basics of the game
    under your belt, don't be afraid to check the
    [guides](/wiki/Job_Guides "wikilink") on the other positions available.
    Not only is it more fun, but you might actually get to help the
    station!

<!-- -->

-   **Help out the game:** If you're good with programming, drawing
    sprites, telling stories or designing maps, feel free to drop by and
    show us what you can do.

Most importantly, have fun! After all, isn't that we're all here for?

Welcome to V.O.R.E. and enjoy your stay!
