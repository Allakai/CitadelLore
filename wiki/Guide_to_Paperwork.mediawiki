Writing is an integral part to paperwork and writing books! If you want to write an official department memo, or a good looking book, you're gonna have to know how to write it. Listed below are the examples of how to properly format in-game paperwork! '''We do not enforce the use of these examples exactly. This is to simply to give you a good base to work from.'''  Much of this work has been siphoned off from many different places in the SS13 community. Notable examples being two Separate [http://baystation12.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=6193 Baystation] --  [http://baystation12.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=6193 forum] posts, and parts of the [https://doku.ss13polaris.com/doku.php?id=game:guides:paperwork:example_paperwork Polaris] wiki. These examples already have most of the special notation included,To properly understand how the notation works, you will need a basic grasp of BBCode or HTML. But don't worry, even if you don't know either, just try copy pasting the examples and replacing the text with your own! Once you're comfortable with that, try experimenting with what works together and how.

==Writing tools and Formatting key==
Writing is performed on paper using any standard writing utensil.

*'''Pens''' come in a few different colors, black or blue by default, and some departments are provided with red pens. Pens have a variety of functions!
*'''Crayons''' work much like pens, except that they are always bold, and lack the list, horizontal rule, and small tags.

===Formatting Paper:===

====Signature====
To sign your name, use the [sign] tag. Remember that '''if you use the [sign] tag, your signature is unique and cannot be forged in most cases.'''
<pre>Your signature: [sign]</pre>

====Field====
To insert a field from which you can start writing (instead of just using the bottom of the paper), use the [field] tag.
<pre>Reason for Request: [field]</pre>

====New Lines====
New lines can be created by using the [br] tag. Without this, anything you write will continue on the same line until it reaches the end of the page.
<pre>text above
[br]
text below</pre>

====Bold====
To make text bold, enclose it within the [b] and [/b] tags.
<pre>[b]This text is going to be bold.[/b] This text is not.</pre>

====Italics====
To italicize text, enclose it within the [i] and [/i] tags.
<pre>[i]This text is italicized.[/i] This text is not.</pre>

====Underlining====
To underline text, enclose it within the [u] and [/u] tags.
<pre>[u]This text is underlined.[/u] This text is not.</pre>

====Centering====
To center text, enclose it with the [center] and [/center] tags.
 <nowiki>[center]Type the center tags onto the paper like this![/center]</nowiki>

====Lists====
Create a list by using the [list] and [/list] tags. For every entry in your list, add a [*] in front of your entry.
For example;
 [list][*]Bullet one.[*]Bullet two.[/list]

====Large Text====
Make text larger, enclose it within the [large] and [/large] tags. Large text like this can be used for emphasis or for titles.
<pre>[large]This text is much larger[/large] than this text.</pre>

====Small Text====
To shrink text, enclose it with the [small] and [/small] tags.
Shrunken text can be used to fit more information onto your paper.
<pre>[small]This text is very small![/small] This text is normal-sized.</pre>

====Horizontal rules====
To add a horizontal rule, use the [hr] tag.
<pre>text above
[hr]
text below</pre>

====NT Logo====
To add the NT logo, use the [logo] tag.

= Character Records =
First you should take a look at the information your character ''should'' have before starting their first day working on station. ("s''hould" Meaning that this paper work is entirely optional, but would greatly help you and others when role-playing.)''  Your character should have the following records: Employment, Medical and Security! These should be filled out as if they were being written about your character from a [[NanoTrasen|NT]] or [[List of Trans-Stellar Corporations|another corporation]] staff member's point of view. '''''While we do not enforce how these records are written, Just like your actual character please make sure your records fit with our stations "[[Backstory|canon]]" and "[[rules]]".'''''

[hr][br]
[center][b]Golden rule:[/b][/center] [center]Keep communications up at all times on the Medical Channel and report all patient treatments, Prescriptions Et cetera![/center][br]
[hr][br]
[b]Guidelines[/b][br]
[*] As a Medical doctor you are not required to do the chems, No. But you are required to at least do the basic chems. Two bottles are enough. This includes:
Dylovene, Dermaline, Biracidine, Dexalin Plus.[br]
[*]As a chemist however, you are required to do the advanced chems as well.[br]
[*]Maintain equipment in peak condition at all times.[br]
[*]Stay calm under all circumstances, Patients tend to get nervous if their doctor is nervous.[br]
[*]Each treatment should be added to the patients medical records![br]
[*][b]Always[/b] lock Medical lockers & logout of Medical terminals after each use.[br]
[*]Never forget the Hippocratic oath.[br]
[*]Non-Disclosure Policy. We are not allowed to give out information about our patients. That includes the reason of their death. Special circumstances can change that. Read the Medical SoP ( Standard Operating Procedure ).[br]
[*]If the Virology lab is being used, Notify your fellow employee's on the medical channel.[br]
[*]Respect the chain of command! The Chief Medical Officer outranks you. The captain outranks the CMO. That does not mean that the Captain can ignore the Non-Disclosure Policy.[br]
[*]Just because you are a Nurse, Surgeon or Emergency Physician, doesn't mean that you are not required to treat patients.[br]
[*][b]Prioritize Patients:[/b] minor damage can be treated later. ( Sometimes you should apply Spacecilin though, to avoid infections). More important cases take priority.[br]
[*]Maintain proper manners! As a Medical Doctor of 'Nanotrasen' You must maintain a proper uniform appearance.[br]
[*]Always have your Medical Belt filled with some basic chems at the very least. Not being equipped properly are grounds for a demotion.[br]
[*]Going to cryo with Gear will result in a [b]suspension[/b] from the Medical team. [b][[But seriously try to take your gear off, Weâll understand if it was an emergency but try to not cryo with gear]].[/b][br]
[*]The front desk of the Medbay doesn't /have/ to be manned at all times. The crew has headsets for a reason. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be manned at all times.[br]
[*]Wash your hands before you do surgery. Wear latex gloves and a sterile mask. Wash those too.[br]
[*]Personal Note: Under my command, You should keep your medical belt equipped. Including your hud. I understand if you not much is going on and you're doing whatever you do. But if I see someone walking in as the shift started. Not getting equipped and heading out already, I'll fire you without a warning.[br]

[b]Golden rule:[/b] [center]Keep communications up at all times on the Security Channel and
report all movements, arrests and all security matters over the radio.[/center][br]
[hr][br]
[b]Guidelines[/b][br]
[*]Talk first, stun second.[br]
[*]Always call for backup before attempting to confront a possibly dangerous criminal.[br]
[*]Charge your weapons after every usage.[br]
[*]Stay calm under all circumstances, anger and fear show weakness.[br]
[*]Always lock Security lockers & logout of security terminals after each use.[br]
[*]Seal off crime scenes and wait for forensics personnel to arrive.[br]
[*]Avoid using force where possible.[br]
[*]Inform the Warden when a criminal is wanted and set their wanted status via your security hud if possible. Beepsky is a force to be reckoned with.[br]
[*]Respect the chain of command! The Warden outranks you within the brig itself. Obey the Head of Security, but remember that the Captain outranks him.[br]
[*]Remember your priorities: One punch is hardly something to arrest anyone over if there is a hostage situation.[br]
