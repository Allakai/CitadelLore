*Or: How The Server Should Be Ideally*

The goal of Citadel Station is to provide a fun SS13 environment for our
intended playerbase, and to keep things reasonably modern and current,
while remaining amenable to requests from the intended playerbase.

The intended playerbase:

-   Is interested in ERP on the server
-   Is interested in playing SS13 as a game
-   Will not eschew casual RP in general
-   Enjoys participating in the setting
-   Will contribute to the environment

The environment and setting should be kept suitable for this intended
playerbase, and as such, there is a set of criteria that the environment
should be kept towards:

-   Being “heavy roleplay” (e.g. most interactions with others are fully
    roleplayed)
-   Has natural roleplay opportunities invoked by mechanics
-   Allows roleplay and mechanics to coexist in equal amounts
-   Does not allow an individual to accomplish large tasks in isolation
    without RP
