First method destroys it, giving two sets of metal rods. Wirecutters will remove it instantly, attacking the grill will instead kick it, requiring a good few kicks. Second loosens the grille, allowing it to be pulled around. Destroying the grill in this method will leave behind a still-secured section of broken grill which may be walked over but is not aesthetically pleasing. Wirecutters will not instantly remove this remnant. However, using a lit welder will destroy it instantly.
