===[[File:PFlash.gif|64px]]Portable Flash===
A portable flasher is an effective device that when secured to the ground, will automatically emit a bright light, stunning anyone who runs past and is not wearing a form of protection against bright lights.
To prepare a portable flasher, first bring it to the desired area, then use a wrench to secure the bolts to the ground. Once you have done that, the portable flasher will draw power from the local APC.
A secured portable flasher will emit a bright flash when it's motion sensors detect someone moving past at running speeds.
If you are not wearing a form of bright light eye protection (such as sunglasses or a welding helmet) you will become momentarily stunned if you are close to the portable flasher when it goes off.

===[[File:Deployable_Barrier.gif|64px]]Deployable Barrier===
A deployable barrier that can be used to block an entrance or as a barricade against armed forces during red alerts.

===[[File:Recharger.gif|64px]]Recharger===
A conventional energy device recharger is a useful device which can recharge any energy based device should it run out of power. As a member of security you will most likely be using these to recharge your energy guns and tasers.
The recharge time of your energy based devices will vary depending on their maximum capacity.

===[[File:Implantbox.png|64px]]Tracking Implant===
Box full of tracking utensils.

===[[File:Implantbox.png|64px]]Chemical Implant===
Box of stuff used to implant chemicals.

===[[File:Handcuffsbox.png|64px]][[File:Handcuffs.png|50px]]Handcuffs=== 
Throw a pair in your pocket, more can be dispensed from the SecTech. It prevents doors from opening, items being held, and escape if the [[crew|person]] being restrained is being pulled. A restraint for the hands, in order to restrain a suspect simply pull him while he is handcuffed. Be careful not to bump into anybody else! It may loosen the prisoner from your grip, allowing him to run free.

To handcuff a perp, you must grab the suspect in an aggressive grab before being able to cuff him/her. Do so by setting to grab intent and grabbing him with an empty hand.

A [[Syndicate_Items#Freedom Implant|freedom implant]] can remove them instantly, but everyone else has to struggle with them for two or more minutes in a private area to get them off without outside help. Can be combined with orange prison [[shoes]] to make foot shackles, which force a person to always walk.

Keep in mind a prisoner is capable of removing handcuffs in roughly two minutes. If you see them attempt this and they are not yet secured in the brig it is standard protocol to use a hand-held flash to briefly incapacitate them. Simply warn them that this is resisting arrest. Only if they attempt to remove the handcuffs a second time should you penalize them for it.

===[[File:SpaceLaw.png|64px]] Corporate Regulations === 
An official copy of [[Corporate Regulations]] is made available to all security personnel. Ensure that you understand it and don't be afraid to literally throw the book at anyone who contests it.

===[[File:Flash.gif|64px]]Flash=== 
A versatile tool! Flashes are a small device capable of producing an extremely bright light, that is capable of blinding someone for approximately one second if they are immediately adjacent to you. This light will overcome visual senses, causing disorientation while the brain tries to process or block the sudden input overload and fleeting pain or discomfort. If you target them specifically with the flash you will not only blind them, but knock them down with enough time to handcuff them. This is an acceptable alternative to a [[stun baton]] in a pinch. However, it will not work against anybody wearing protective eye coverings such as [[Welding Helmets]] or [[Sunglasses]] (note: this does not apply to [[Borgs]], strangely. Overexposure can cause blindness, and the flash's bulb is prone to burning out. Despite having Flashes implanted as occular devices, hand held flashes can be used to stun a rogue [[cyborg]]). Carry it in your pocket. Distributed by SecTech vendors.

Some [[Game_Modes#Revolution|revolutionary]] leaders can use flashes to brainwash other members of the crew if they are not wearing protective gear.

===[[File:Pepperspray.png|64px]]Pepperspray=== 
Just a pepperspray, used to temporarily blind a criminal. Best used instead of a stun baton when your opponent doesn't have any eye protection, because unlike a stun baton, even if they disarm you, they can't use it against you as long as you're wearing your own Security HUD glasses. Aim for the eyes.

===[[File:Hailer.png|64px]]Hailer===

===[[File:RiotS.png|64px]][[File:Metal_Riot_Shield.png|64px]]Riot Shield===

===[[File:Scanner.png|64px]]Forensic Scanner===
Used for identifying blood and finger prints on any object. Wearing [[gloves]] prevents finger prints being left behind. It has two modes, one in which it just scans and another where it will print out a card outlining the results of that scan as well. The [[detective]] starts with one of these and has a spare in his locker.

===[[File: Tape Recorder.gif|64px]]Tape Recorder===
When activated, it records all spoken conversations around a specific area. It is able to print out transcripts of the recordings on-demand. It spawns in various locations around the station, including (but not limited to) the [[Library]] and [[Brig]].

== Weapons ==

===[[File:StunBaton.gif|64px]]Stun Baton=== 
Security's bread and butter. Stun batons have two modes: on and off. While on, the baton delivers 'HALLOSS' damage, and the first hit will cause the target to slow down, while  the second hit will cause him to lose consciousness, similar to taser hits.

To recharge a stun baton, take out its battery using a screwdriver, and recharge it at a cell recharger, before sticking the battery back into the baton.

 '''Note:'''Stunning someone on harm intent will cause him/her to bleed, giving him brute damage. Be a professional officer and do not use the baton on harm intent.

===[[File:Telebaton.png|64px]]Telescopic Baton===
A baton used by the head of security and the Captain. Extremely harmful. Not to be used if you still want the suspect to be able to talk.

===[[File:Tasernew.png|64px]]Taser=== 
This is a ranged alternative to the [[stun baton]], however it only has five charges. Maintain both this at a [[recharger port]]. 

Like the baton, you should wear this on your belt and carry the other in your backpack. The taser fires an incandescent ball of energy at low velocity, the projectile is stopped by windows, grills, walls, and various other obstructions. These bolts cause temporary paralysis because of the convulsions and speech will be painfully slurred.

Clicking on someone adjacent to you on any non-harm intent will cause you to stun them much like a [[stun baton]], except for a much longer time.

Melee use of this weapon is inappropriate except for the most extreme cases [[Space_law#Major_Crimes|(see Corporate Regulations section Dangerous Criminals)]]. When aiming for the head, tazers are exceptional melee weapons even when out of charge, very often knocking the opponent unconscious with a single blow.

===[[File:egun.gif]]Energy Gun===
Distributed by the [[Warden]]. The combination of a [[tazer]] and a [[laser gun]], just click to alternate between a killing laser and a stunning tazer; they default to stun. More shots will be fired if exclusively used in kill mode than exclusively used in stun mode before its energy is depleted, but it can be recharged. Like tasers, energy guns make exceptional melee weapons due to their uncanny ability to knock people unconscious when aimed for the head. The [[Captain]], [[head of Personnel]], and [[Head of Security]] all have energy guns in their quarters. More are stored in the armoury and can be ordered in a [[Supply_crates#SECURITY|secure crate]] by the [[quartermaster]]s. They are to be distributed only under the [[Space_law#Major_Crimes|most extreme circumstances]].

These also can be ordered by the [[quartermaster]]s in a [[Supply_crates#SECURITY|secure weapons crate]], which itself can only able to be opened by a [[security]] officer or military head of staff, It can be recharged.

===[[File:Laser.png|64px]] Practice Laser Gun===

This is an advanced piece of equipment because it is so difficult to use. Also distributed by SecTech vendors or the Warden. In room breaches where multiple or armed personnel are expected, you may use a flashbrang to "breach' the room. Select it, press the button, and throw it immediately. It will blind everyone nearby for a short period of time and deafen them for a longer period of time. If all goes well, they will be on the ground, having dropped their weapons, and awaiting your handcuffs.

These are used well in conjunction with the handcuffs. Simply use a pair of cuffs on a pair of orange shoes found in the brig lockers. Remove your suspect's footwear and replace them with the shackles and they will no longer be able to run free if bumped from your grasp. This is a very useful tool.
