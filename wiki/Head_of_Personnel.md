The [Head of Personnel](/wiki/Head_of_Personnel "wikilink") is in charge of
assigning and reassigning crew members correctly and making sure station
departments are well-staffed and running optimally (and stay that way).
They are on the same level as all of the other [heads of
staff](/wiki/Chain_of_Command "wikilink") and do not outrank any of them;
however, you are the only one besides the [Colony
Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink") who has access to the
Identification Card Modifier.

Your Own Department
-------------------

As a Head of Staff you have your own department to watch out for. You're
charge of coordinating the [civilian
personnel](/wiki/Job_Guides#Civilian "wikilink") and supply staff on the
station. This also includes the
[Quartermaster](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink") and [Cargo
Technicians](/wiki/Cargo_Technician "wikilink"). Usually, you can let the
station's various [Bartenders](/wiki/Bartender "wikilink") and
[Librarians](/wiki/Librarian "wikilink") run around and take care of
themselves. They are technically under your direct command, but their
jobs are usually simple and not particularly vital to the running of the
station.

Human Resources
---------------

You are the Head of Personnel. You get access to just about everything,
including basic access to every department on the station. While you can
also give yourself full access, this is a major breach of your powers
and job. Your main responsibility is to manage the crew and make sure
each department is fully staffed and working efficiently. Depending on
how many crew members there are, that may mean some people pulling
double shifts or having to do jobs they're not so good at doing.

### A Full Department Is a Happy Department

When a department is lacking in crew members, you are expected to take
the initiative to **hire more crew members for that department.**
Offering pay raises, reimbursements, or recommending people into certain
departments are all good ways of convincing people to transfer to a
department that needs more staff members. Denying (or "strongly
discouraging") crew members a transfer into a fully-staffed department
is a good way of getting staff in the places you need them as well.

### A Happy Department Is a Productive Department

Now that a certain department is staffed, it also falls under your and
[Internal Affairs'](/wiki/Internal_Affairs "wikilink") jurisdiction to make
sure that each of the departments are running smoothly. Check up with
all of the other department heads frequently to make sure that there
aren't any inter-department problems or any major problems between crew
members.

The Reassignment: A Way of Life
-------------------------------

Your other job is reassigning people when they come to your desk with
one or more access requests. Make sure that he or she has a good,
justified reason to want a job change. A [Chef](/wiki/Chef "wikilink") who
suddenly wants to become a [Security](/wiki/Security "wikilink") is a good
example of someone who should be heavily scrutinized.

Feel free to deny someone's transfer request if you get a poor
explanation as to how someone suddenly came into possession of his or
her sudden inter-department knowledge (My uncle was in a war/I read it
in a book/I just know, are all pretty bad reasons). Alternatively, set
them up with a subservient, or assistant position, until they've proven
that they can do the job correctly (custom assignment titles are useful
for this!).

### You're Hired, Welcome Aboard

If someone's job transfer request isn't completely ridiculous, then it's
time for you to do some background checks. Make sure the crew member
knows what they're (going to be) doing inside of his or her new
department. Once you've determined someone is a potential candidate for
a job transfer, it's a good idea to grab one of several versions of [job
transfer form](/wiki/Paperwork "wikilink"). Pick out one that you like and
give the form to the guy waiting for his job change; ask him to fill it
out. Keeping a record of all of the access changes you give out is key
to keeping everyone else informed about what you're doing and keeping
you out of the [brig](brig "wikilink").

Here comes the hard part. Now that you have a filled out form, you
should get it [signed](/wiki/Paperwork#Signature "wikilink") and stamped by an
appropriate [head of staff](/wiki/Chain_of_Command "wikilink"). Usually, this
involves getting the department head's attention in one way or another,
be it talking to them over the radio or sending your man to the
department itself. Again, keeping a record of a department head's
consent on file is usually one of the best ways to prove that your
access change wasn't [completely
illegal](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink"). The shorthand version of
this process would be to inform the head of staff in question about the
transfer over the [Command radio channel](/wiki/Radio "wikilink") and get
quick consent from there.

Finally, when everything is signed, stamped, and filled out, you can
sign the form yourself. Ask the man for his [Identification
Card](/wiki/ID "wikilink") so that you can officially give them the requested
job title and access. Unless someone would like a specific job title,
make sure to use the generic job titles near the top of the screen so
that [Security](/wiki/Security_Officer "wikilink") can identify that person
much more easily with their fancy SecHUDs.

### You're Fired

As well as handing out job transfers, it's also well within your
authority to demote people and take those jobs away.

If someone falls asleep on the job or messes something up, you are well
within your rights to demote them to a lower position after consulting
the appropriate head of staff. Demoting a head of staff, however, is
something that should not be done without the [Colony
Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink")'s **written** consent.

Occasionally, a head of staff will request that a crew member be demoted
for varying reasons. All heads of staff are within the right to demote
members of their own department, and it's your job to fulfill that need.
A head of staff cannot physically remove a crew member from the station
entirely, however. That's something [Central
Command](/wiki/Central_Command "wikilink") would need to be contacted to do,
as there would need to be special transportation or arrangements to do
so.

Rarely will a crew member be removed from his or her position as a
[NanoTrasen](/wiki/NanoTrasen "wikilink") employee entirely. Only the [Colony
Director](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink") has the power to authorize such a
procedure and it is seldom practiced. However, it has happened on
numerous occasions. When a crew member is removed from the station, he
or she is essentially "fired": that person is given no job, pay, or
privileges and is removed from the station on the next Crew Transfer
Shuttle pending further review by NanoTrasen at [Central
Command](/wiki/Virgo-Erigone#CentCom "wikilink").

### In Case of Emergency, Break Glass

Sometimes people need access to certain departments in an emergency, and
the AI isn't up to the task of opening doors for people. Feel free to
hand out emergency access to people such as [Security
Officers](/wiki/Security_Officer "wikilink") if the situation calls for it.
Once the crisis has been averted, however, make sure to call them all
back so you can revert them to their standard access.
[A](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink") [number](Chief_Engineer "wikilink")
[of](/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer "wikilink")
[people](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink") really do not like it when crew
members go walking into their department for no real reason just because
they have access to it. **Handing out unapproved and unjustifiable
access is one of the fastest ways to get you demoted.**

The Five Points of Human Resources Management
---------------------------------------------

The Head of Personnel can be a rather varied job. He can savor the
prestige or feel shackled to the ID computer. If you find yourself
wearing teal, make the most of it by doing your job correctly.

1.  **Support the Colony Director**. Be sure to work as a team to lead
    the crew. Earn this trust by making frequent use of command chat
    (:c) and deferring to him on matters of great importance, like
    assigning new heads or calling the shuttle. You do not outrank the
    other heads, but you have the unique position of being able to
    assign people. You are the one who will take over should the Colony
    Director need to step down, so it'd be a good idea to look like a
    good leader in front of him.
2.  **Uphold the Rights of Crewmen**. Security often commits excesses
    and the Colony Director is either dead or personally involved in a
    case. Rarely, you will be forced to do the impromptu job of a
    pseudo-Administrator and make difficult decisions about the fate of
    a crewman should the Colony Director be missing,
    [dead](/wiki/Traitor "wikilink"), [eaten](Vore "wikilink"), or [personally
    involved](/wiki/Changeling "wikilink"). In these situations, remember to
    consider every side of the story before making a decision and try to
    follow [Corporate Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink")
    while still giving out a fair sentence. Almost always, a weak Colony
    Director and Head of Personnel will result in [bad
    Security](shitcurity "wikilink").
3.  **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege**. When assigning new
    access levels or creating new jobs, ask yourself just how much
    access is really needed to perform the task. If a hardworking
    engineer wants EVA access, consider if he really needs access, or
    just for you to open the door for him while he gets a suit. If the
    [Counselor](/wiki/Chaplain "wikilink") is being proactive about finding
    bodies but often needs people to open doors, maybe the risk of
    giving him more access is less than gain from increasing his
    effectiveness. Decisions like these keep the station more secure and
    cuts down on the number of accidental arrests made by Security for
    assumed trespassing. Remember to write their increased access or
    privileged items on a [sheet of paper](/wiki/Paperwork "wikilink") and
    give it a good stamping so the Janitor will be able to show why he's
    mopping the Medbay floors.
4.  **Talk to the Crew**. The Colony Director is often too busy dealing
    with who knows what. The Head of Security is usually trying to keep
    his department in check. The Research Director is on fire, the Chief
    Medical Officer is up to his elbows injured people, and the Chief
    Engineer is trying to keep everyone warm and breathing in a vacuum.
    You're really the only Head able to take time and listen to the
    crew. Invite crewmen to talk to you when there are conflicts. Defuse
    the interpersonal and interdepartmental problems you discover during
    these conversations, and prevent grievances from becoming grief.
    Advocate on behalf of the beaten to security, and generally reduce
    the frequency and intensity of mutinies.
5.  **Manage your Department First**. While technically you can demote
    everyone who's ID you seize to Assistant, managing civilian workers
    not under another head is your immediate responsibility. Keeping
    janitors on task, directing the Chef to throw a pizza party, and
    getting the records up to date are the first thing to do after
    assigning job and access changes. Demoting bad [Security
    Officers](/wiki/Security_Officer "wikilink") or stepping in for an absent
    department head also falls on your desk, but going into other
    departments to micromanage in front of their head is both bad form
    and likely to make you reviled. Always clear a demotion with their
    department head, or ideally, have all the heads aware they can send
    troublesome employees your way to be sent to the mining base. This
    lets you focus on your immediate underlings and avoid stepping on
    toes.

Acting Colony Director and You

<img src="Corgi.PNG" title="fig:Corgi.PNG" alt="Corgi.PNG" width="64" />Ian
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ian, who starts in your office, is a dog that keeps you company. You can
pet him or just pull him around for fun. Please try to be sensible about
him.

It is traditional to rescue Ian if the V.O.R.E. has to be evacuated.

Hurting Ian will get you lynched.

Links to Other Departments
--------------------------

Your job as head of personnel is to make sure all the necessary roles
are filled. Check the crew manifest--is there a researcher who will want
materials, but no miner to supply them? A cook, but no gardener? Three
surgeons, but no chemist? If there's a gap in the chain of production,
everything will slow down, and it's your job to fill those gaps. Whether
you transfer someone from one job to another, or just give someone
enough access to fill in for an empty role when it's needed, make sure
the person you've put in the job is qualified to do it.

Predding
--------

As the head of personnel, you have the ability to get access to your
<s>victim</s> friend's workplace. Your office also has privacy shutters.
Do remember to keep your meal from screaming too much, you're still
liable to get into trouble, or even demoted by the [Fun
Police](/wiki/Colony_Director "wikilink").

Roleplaying Tips
----------------

-   You should have good knowledge of the [Chain of
    Command](/wiki/Chain_of_Command "wikilink"). **Remember that you do not
    usurp the HoS's place if he is missing as of now**
-   As an example, you could play as a subservient right hand man to the
    Colony Director, or a devious <s>power</s> hungry maniac, only
    serving to further your own <s>career</s> lunch goals. Remember,
    whatever you choose, try to enjoy it, and try not to ruin the round
    for other people.
-   You may have access to it, but you are not (read
    <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">NOT</span>)
    [Security](/wiki/Security_Officer "wikilink"). Chasing and arresting
    criminals should be left to the likes of [Security
    Officers](/wiki/Security_Officer "wikilink") and possibly the [Head of
    Security](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink"). Your armor and weapon is for
    your protection only and does not give you the right to chase after
    criminals. If you should happen across a crime, pulling your weapon
    may hinder more than help.
-   You can use the [Guide to Paperwork](/wiki/Guide_to_Paperwork "wikilink")
    if you want to make your own forms, or use the [Example
    Paperwork](/wiki/Example_Paperwork "wikilink") page.
-   If you are feeling bored, you have one of the jobs with most
    possibilities for a relaxing chat with any crew member, you are the
    man of the people, try to find out more about the crew.
-   Be wary, even though you can substitute missing Heads of the Staff
    you should not be doing their department's work, instead of giving
    yourself the access to the place and forcing everyone to do your
    bidding, act like you know about the job but you are not able to
    perform the activity, don't steal other people's jobs.
-   The [Internal Affairs](/wiki/Internal_Affairs "wikilink") does not fall
    under your command, but you should work with them in finding corrupt
    or unfit crew members. <s>Destroy [Bad
    Security](/wiki/Bad_Security "wikilink")</s> Don't try to optimize too
    much.
-   You are an important crew member, try to not distract yourself too
    much.
