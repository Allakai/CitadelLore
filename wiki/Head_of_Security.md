The [Head of Security](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink") is in charge of the
[Security](/wiki/Security "wikilink") forces on the station. They command the
[Warden](/wiki/Warden "wikilink"), [Detective](/wiki/Detective "wikilink"), and
[Security Officers](/wiki/Security_Officers "wikilink") and make sure that
they [don't ruin everything](/wiki/Bad_Security "wikilink").

Job Description
---------------

Your job isn't to hunt people down, unless <s>it's an urgent matter in
one of the many places your normal security officers can't get into</s>
you're really hungry, so you can usually just sit in your office and let
the [securitrons](/wiki/Roboticist#Securitron "wikilink") and officers do it
for you. You have more access to the station than anyone else in
security, but less than the other heads. Try not to depend on it.

You are concerned with the following people:

-   [Security Officers](/wiki/Security_Officers "wikilink"): These are your
    pawns, and it's your job to control them. If they're being
    incompetent resource wasters, yell at them and get them to fall in
    line. If they continue, tell them to stop or have them
    [demoted](vore "wikilink"). A security officer that does not do his
    job properly shouldn't even have this job in the first place.

<!-- -->

-   [The Warden](/wiki/Warden "wikilink"): They act as the brig's watch dog.
    Make sure he doesn't set and/or support unfair and bad brig times,
    that he doesn't leave the Brig all the time, and he won't bother
    you. He also hands out equipment in emergencies, and will take over
    if you happen to be unavailable.

<!-- -->

-   [The Detective](/wiki/Detective "wikilink"): Also known as a Forensic
    Technician, their job is to close off crime scenes and investigate
    evidence and people. They are firmly under your command, regardless
    of what they may say.

<!-- -->

-   [Internal Affairs](/wiki/Internal_Affairs "wikilink"): Should security or
    anyone else be acting out of their job description Internal Affairs
    can be called in. They conduct their own investigations to determine
    whether someone has overstepped their power or authority. You have
    no direct authority over them. Despite them having a security
    headset, they are not special agents.

Strategy
--------

### Officers, Roll Out

The first step towards keeping the station safe is to ensure that your
own officers aren't a threat. Security enforces the law, but they are
not above it - and neither are you. Make sure that all of your personnel
are familiar with the regulations regarding [Corporate
Regulations](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink"), [Standard Operating
Procedure](/wiki/Standard_Operating_Procedure "wikilink"), and [standard
Security practices](/wiki/Guide_to_Security "wikilink").

Once your force is up to speed on the rules and regulations, send them
out on patrol. Pay attention to all the radio channels for any calls for
help. If there are any, dispatch some officers to handle it, and make
sure that the [Detective](/wiki/Detective "wikilink") collects any relevant
evidence. Make sure that the Warden keeps the Security records
up-to-date, not in the least because Beepsky can help your officers
catch criminals who would otherwise evade them.

### Laying Down the Law

Check to make sure that appropriate times are given out for violations
of Corporate Regulations, and that your department only arrest people
who have actually committed crimes. Remember, if they're doing something
that you don't like but is technically not against the law, you can
issue an official injunction - preferably in a official sounding
language, written, and stamped with your Head of Security stamp -
against it. Expect abuse of this power to be called out, however.

If one of your officers misbehave, yell at them, or in more serious
cases, show them the inside of a cell. Keep them busy by sending them on
patrols, leads, and follow-ups. An unoccupied officer is often a [bad
officer.](/wiki/Bad_Security "wikilink")

#### El Capitan

It is also important that you understand the relationship between
Security and the [Captain](/wiki/Captain "wikilink"). The Captain's authority
on the station is absolute, except where it conflicts with Corporate
Regulations; the Captain cannot pardon criminals, cannot get away with
committing crimes, and so on. The only time that Corporate Regulations
can be overridden is when there is an imminent and overwhelming threat
to the station. Other Heads of Staff are required to follow Corporate
Regulations as well. **However**, this does not mean that you are the
law. You are still outranked by the Captain. You can only arrest the
Captain, or other Heads of Staff, if they've actually committed a crime.
Until that time, you have to follow orders just like anyone else.

Finally, always remember to follow [standard security
procedures!](/wiki/Guide_to_Security#Standard_Procedure "wikilink")

Office
------

Your office is in the [Brig](/wiki/Brig "wikilink"). It holds various security
equipment for use in apprehending and detaining criminals. Your office
also has both a security records computer and a security camera potato
which you can use to monitor the station from the comfort of your desk
chair.

Brig
----

The holding area for prisoners. Only people with access to security can
enter. It's still possible for normal crewmembers to view the cells
through the windows behind them. As the windows are electrified, though,
they're not a valid means of entry unless the person happens to have
insulated gloves, which non-engineering personnel should not have.

The brig also has blast doors in all of the windows, as well as the
halls into the cells. There's a button to drop them in the warden's
office and your office.

Prisoners may try to flee, so do something about the doors (portable
flasher), or handcuff them to the bed as you investigate their items
(make sure to then release from the bed and cuffs if they aren't
dangerous). And, **SET A TIME TO THE TIMER** (the door won't lock unless
you do this). Make sure to [keep the time to the
crime](/wiki/Corporate_Regulations "wikilink").

In the event that a prisoner has been deemed too dangerous to release,
they can either be executed with explicit permission from the Captain,
kept in a secure holding cell <s>(like your stomach)</s>, or put in the
prison wing. These should only be done after a trial however.

Links to Other Departments
--------------------------

As Head of Security, you coordinate your actions with the captain, the
other heads of staff, and your officers. You will often work with
Medical, when a crime results in injury, when a prisoner is hurt, or
when a patient is violent. When a criminal damages station
infrastructure, you will work with Engineering to determine what
happened and whether it's safe for your officers to investigate. Supply
and Research can get you high-powered weapons if you need them. And do
try to keep the janitor from thoughtlessly cleaning up the evidence.

Predding
--------

You have four [lunch boxes](brig "wikilink") for naughty crew members.
You also have ways of subduing your meals (**remember roleplay is
required**) if you're not too popular.
