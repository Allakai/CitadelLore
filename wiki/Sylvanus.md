**Sylvanusians**, nicknamed 'Elves' by [Humans](/wiki/Humans "wikilink"),
refers to a humanoid species that thrives in scattered, dissociated
colonies throughout the frontier regions and beyond. While
[some](/wiki/Livius_Thraun "wikilink") claim the race to originate from the
mysterious planet [Ashkel](/wiki/Ashkel "wikilink"), other
[factions](/wiki/Scion "wikilink") dispute that claim, alleging that Ashkel
may not even exist as anything more than legend.

Sylvanusian technology ranges from utterly primitive in some cases, to
being as advanced as the [Skrell](/wiki/Skrell "wikilink") as is the case with
the [Aureum Imperium](/wiki/Aureum_Imperium "wikilink"). Aureum Sylvanusians
in particular are in possession of technology that appears similar to
known [precursor](precursor "wikilink") artifacts. It is not known
whether they have developed the technology themselves, or are merely
borrowing ancient machinery.

Sylvanusian societies are generally very secretive, refusing to divulge
even the most trivial details of their culture to outsiders.

Overview
========

Sylvanusians don't actually exist as a species coded into the server,
and must be made using the **Custom Species** feature. This is
intentional so that there's a great deal of flexibility in what your
particular flavor of space elf gets to be. However, here are some
commonalities we'd like to see across all elves.

-   Sylvanusian typically speak a language similar to Latin, so adding
    Tradeband to your character's languages is recommended. The
    languages are so closely related that they can be understood by each
    other. Anyone who knows Tradeband will be able to communicate with a
    Sylvanusian and vise-versa, though a Tradeband speaker will know a
    Sylvanusian speaker uses archaic versions of some words.
-   Sylvanusian names will sound like ancient Greek, ancient Latin, or
    ancient Roman. Celtic is probably fine too. For example, [Livius
    Thraun](/wiki/Livius_Thraun "wikilink"). Made up names are also fine, as
    long as they sound interesting enough.
-   Sylvanusians come in two main varieties. Normal Sylvanusian, and
    'Dark' Sylvanusian. The former will have coloration similar to that
    of humans, while the latter tend to have a darker gray or a deep
    blue skin, often accompanied with piercing red or neon green eyes.
-   Sylvanusians are similar to humans in most ways, and have little
    physical disadvantages or advantages compared to them. Dark
    Sylvanusians are often photosensitive, but can also see better in
    the dark. Adjust your character traits accordingly when making one.
-   Sylvanusians have lifespans far exceeding humans, and do not visibly
    age. The alleged empress of the [Auream
    Imperium](/wiki/Auream_Imperium "wikilink") is said to be immortal.
    Sylvanusians exploring outside of their home system will typically
    be aged between 30 to 100 years old. Ages beyond that typically do
    not interact with outsiders, and are much more conservative and
    possess stoic personalities.
-   Sylvanusians are generally not trusted in command positions, as
    NanoTrasen still knows too little about them.
-   Sylvanusians do not view slavery in the same negative context as
    other races. To Sylvanusians, willingly giving yourself into slavery
    under a timed contract can be a means of paying off a debt. Carrying
    debts in Sylvanusian societies is generally seen as highly
    dishonorable, and will attempt to pay that debt by any means unless
    the debt is forgiven.
-   Sylvanusians are innately fascinated by the artwork of other
    species. Artifacts discovered by
    [Xenoarcheology](/wiki/Xenoarcheology "wikilink") will be highly desirable
    for them to study and try to make sense of, even if the artifact has
    no technological value.
-   When naming your Sylvanusians custom species, you can just use the
    word 'Elf' as a generic term, as this is what most humans will call
    you regardless of your efforts to correct them. When talking to
    other Sylvanusians however, you should go by your faction of origin,
    followed by the word Sylvanusians. For example, an Auream Imperium
    Sylvanusian would be an Auream Sylvanusians. One coming from Scion
    would be a Scion Sylvanusian. If hypothetically one was born on
    Earth (although this doesn't happen, it's just for example), they
    would be a Terran Sylvanusian.
