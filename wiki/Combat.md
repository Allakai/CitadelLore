Also known as Robust/Robusting, jargon for engaging in the combat
system. It's an ironic description. The combat system is pretty quirky
and limiting.

Intents
-------

You intent specifies what you want to do when you click on another
player/mob. You can switch between these by click on the
![](help.png "fig:help.png") on your HUD or by using CTRL+Q or CTRL+E.

-   ![](help.png "fig:help.png") **Help** - The help intent is the
    default intent. You'll shake people or yourself awake if you have no
    items, or perform CPR on them if they're suffocating and both have
    no helmets or masks on. You'll still hit people with most items if
    you're holding one though. You also pass through other people when
    moving through them. Your gun will not fire while on help intent,
    but will aim when clicked on someone. Moreover, any attack on you
    will have a 100% hit chance. Being buckled to something or lying
    down on the floor will also nullify the chance of a hit missing.
-   ![](disarm.png "fig:disarm.png") **Disarm** - A defensive intent.
    You'll attempt to disarm someone of their weapon or push them over
    for a very short while. This has a chance of failing, so repeated
    clicking may be necessary. People cannot run past you with this
    intent.
-   ![](grab.png "fig:grab.png") **Grab** - You'll grab someone
    passively at first. Moving will be slowed if you try to drag them
    around, so for transport, pulling is much faster. Clicking on them
    again will grab them aggressively (which has a chance of failing)
    and allow you to put them on a table to make them lie down or
    handcuff them. Click again will grab them by the neck. You can then
    click on the ![](strangle.png "fig:strangle.png") strangle icon on
    your HUD once to temporarily choke them to disarm them, or double
    click it to start strangling them. You can also hit someone with
    your free hand while having him/her in a choke hold, and your victim
    can do the same. People cannot run past you with this intent.
-   ![](harm.png "fig:harm.png") **Harm** - This intent does **NOT**
    make you do more damage with melee weapons, but decreases your
    chance of missing the targeted area. If you have a [stun
    baton](stun_baton "wikilink") however, you'll beat your target
    instead of stunning them, which knocks them down, but only stuns for
    a very short amount of time. This is generally a bad thing. With
    harm intent on, firing a gun at someone with the
    ![](normalgun.png "fig:normalgun.png") manual fire gun system will
    fire a special point blank shot which does extra damage. With an
    empty hand you'll punch people for around 5 brute damage, and have a
    small chance to land a strong hit , which will have various effects
    depending on the targeted location. People cannot run past you with
    this intent.

The target area in this type of combat matters, especially in harm
intent, for a strong hit will cause differing effects depending on where
the punch/blow lands.

-   A strong hit on the head will cause blurriness and dizziness.
-   A strong hit on the arm will cause the target dropping what he/she
    is holding.
-   A strong hit on the groin will cause HALLOS damage. (Similar to Stun
    Baton/Taser)
-   A strong hit on the chest will send the victim flying to the floor.

Gun System
----------

There are two ways to use guns, the auto fire or manual system. You can
switch between these with the F6 key, or the
![](normalgun.png "fig:normalgun.png") gun icon on your HUD.

-   ![](normalgun.png "fig:normalgun.png") **Manual Fire** - This is the
    default mode for firing guns. Simply click on the tile you want to
    fire and you'll fire in the direction. Click on someone adjacent to
    you will cause you to hit them with your gun, unless you're on
    ![](harm.png "fig:harm.png") harm intent, in which case you'll fire
    a point blank shot at them for extra damage, as long as you have
    ammo. Taser guns have a special extra long stun when adjacent,
    regardless of intent. To fire at someone on the ground, click
    specifically on them, or the shot will go over them.
-   ![](autogun.png "fig:autogun.png") **Auto Fire** - This gun system
    is useful for taking people hostage. When you turn this on and aim
    at someone a reticle will appear on them and they'll get a message
    stating to stop doing anything. After 2 seconds, if they interact
    with anything, you will automatically fire at them. You can allow
    them to walk, run, or use items using icons that will appear on your
    HUD. Clicking in their direction or on them again will fire at them.
    You can click another person to switch your focus to them. Click
    your gun again to stop aiming at your target.

Heavy vs Light
--------------

-   Heavy items do much more damage, but are slower and have a chance to
    miss. Conversely, light weapons to less damage, but always hit and
    swing faster.

Attacking
---------

-   Aim for the head. Knock outs when aiming for the head last longer.
-   If they have a helmet, aim for the chest. If they have body armor
    too, aim for the legs.
-   Click repeatedly.
-   Any object is usually better than your fists. Fire extinguishers
    especially.
-   Screwdrivers have a special blinding attack when aiming for the
    eyes.
-   Harm intent is your best bet.

Defending
---------

-   Run away.
-   If they're too close, disarm, then run away.
-   If you can't run, aim for the head to get a knock out and then run
    away.
-   If they give chase, throw objects at them. Some objects, such as
    metal rods or floor tiles do extra damage when thrown.
-   Stun them, or otherwise attempt to disable them.
-   Try to get a moment to ask for help on the radio, don't forget the
    roleplay.
-   Closing doors takes time, analyze if you have enough time to close a
    door behind you or if you should be using it to run away.
-   Don't move in a straight line when fighting against armed opponents
-   Don't try to move through your opponent, if you being attacked, they
    probably have either harm or grab intent selected, making you unable
    to swap places with them

trying to feed yourself to your objective**

Combat Tips
-----------

-   If you have a legitimate reason too, use Hyperzine beforehand. It
    increases your movement speed considerably.
-   Setting someone on fire is a powerful way to either kill them or
    disable them
-   Instead of going into a click-fest try to roleplay a situation first
-   *Expect to be the one to die.*
