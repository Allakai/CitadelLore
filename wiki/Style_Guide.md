Style Guide for BS12 Wiki Articles
----------------------------------

This is just a quick list of general suggestions for wiki editing
guidelines, after Spectre suggested it. This is more of a meta-wiki page
than an actual page.

-   Whenever possible, properly capitalize links and link names. This
    fits in better with how the Wiki supports article names at a
    software level, and proper nouns are supposed to be capitalized
    anyway.
-   Try not to make every reference to a wiki article a link. The first
    one or two in an article is perfectly sufficient.
-   Fill out the edit summary comment to let people know what changes
    you've made.
-   We try to keep the wiki semi-serious. Making things entertaining to
    read is key, but we don't really need jokes everywhere.
-   Keep on subject. Try to keep articles related to the title. If you
    feel like you're going off on a tangent, try linking to a new
    article.
-   For fluff pages, "NanoTrasen" is typically spelled with two capital
    letters.
-   Avoid double redirects wherever possible. A double redirect is when
    a page redirects you to another redirect page. To avoid infinite
    loops, MediaWiki does not redirect the user more than once at a time
    and double redirects become annoying because of it.

Templates and Categories
------------------------

Here is a list of all Categories and the important Templates we are
using. If you make one, add it to the list (some templates automatically
add categories to an article if you use them).

-   [Templates](/wiki/Category%3ATemplates "wikilink")
-   [Categories](/wiki/Special:Categories "wikilink") (Note: Some Categories
    redirect to a wikipage. To get to the Category, click on the
    reference below the pagename)

**Please read the description in every category and add it to an article
where appropriate.**

### Revision Templates

These templates are used to mark pages with special conditions (such as
a work in progress, an outdated page, etc.)

-   Stubs: [Template](/wiki/Template:Stub "wikilink") and
    [Category](/wiki/Category%3AStubs "wikilink")
-   Outdated page: [Template](/wiki/Template:Outdated "wikilink") and
    [Category](/wiki/Category%3AOutdated "wikilink")
-   Needs Revision: [Template](/wiki/Template:Needs_revision "wikilink")
-   Work in Progress: [Template](/wiki/Template:wip "wikilink") and
    [Category](/wiki/Category%3AWork_in_Progress "wikilink")

<!-- -->

-   Ported Wiki Pages: [Template](/wiki/Template:tgPage "wikilink")
-   Slated for Removal: [Template](/wiki/Template:Delete "wikilink") and
    [Category](/wiki/Category%3ASlated_for_removal "wikilink")
-   Removed Content: [Template](/wiki/Template:RemovedContent "wikilink") and
    [Category](/wiki/Category%3ARemoved_Content "wikilink")

Image Uploads
-------------

In general, uploaded images should be clear and relevant to the content
on the wiki. Ideally, you should only upload an image if you intend to
use that image on a wiki page and if a suitable image doesn't already
exist.

-   If you want to upload an image, check first if there is an older
    version of the image already in the wiki. If there is, update it.
    That will automatically do everything else for you. And it keeps the
    wiki tidy.
    -   A list of all of the images currently on the wiki can be found
        at [Special:ListFiles](/wiki/Special:ListFiles "wikilink").
-   When uploading images, try to use GIF or PNG format. These formats
    are lossless compression formats, unlike JPEG, and are not huge,
    unlike BMP.
-   Ensure images have a transparent background where applicable,
    especially if you want to use that image with a template that has a
    colored background.
