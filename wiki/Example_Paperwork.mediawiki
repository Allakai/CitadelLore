Welcome to the most useful page for in-depth role-players! Listed below are the examples of how to properly format in-game paperwork! '''We do not enforce the use of this paperwork exactly how it is presented here this is simple to give you a good base.'''  Much of this work has been siphoned off from many different places in the SS13 community. Notable examples being two Separate [http://baystation12.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=6193 Baystation] --  [http://baystation12.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=6193 forum] posts, and parts of the [https://doku.ss13polaris.com/doku.php?id=game:guides:paperwork:example_paperwork Polaris] wiki. These examples already have most of the special notation included, But if you wish to learn what each of these notes mean, and how to use it in your own custom paperwork also see: [[Guide to Paperwork]].

= Character Records =
First you should take a look at the information your character ''should'' have before starting their first day working on station. ("s''hould" Meaning that this paper work is entirely optional, but would greatly help you and others when role-playing.)''  Your character should have the following records: Employment, Medical and Security! These should be filled out as if they were being written about your character from a [[NanoTrasen|NT]] or [[List of Trans-Stellar Corporations|another corporation]] staff member's point of view. '''''While we do not enforce having these records, or how it is written, Just like your actual character please make sure your records fit with our stations "[[Backstory|canon]]" and "[[rules]]".'''''

[hr][br]
[b]Golden rule:[/b] [center]Keep communications up at all times on the Security Channel and
report all movements, arrests and all security matters over the radio.[/center][br]
[hr][br]
[b]Guidelines[/b][br]
[*]Talk first, stun second.[br]
[*]Always call for backup before attempting to confront a possibly dangerous criminal.[br]
[*]Charge your weapons after every usage.[br]
[*]Stay calm under all circumstances, anger and fear show weakness.[br]
[*]Always lock Security lockers & logout of security terminals after each use.[br]
[*]Seal off crime scenes and wait for forensics personnel to arrive.[br]
[*]Avoid using force where possible.[br]
[*]Inform the Warden when a criminal is wanted and set their wanted status via your security hud if possible. Beepsky is a force to be reckoned with.[br]
[*]Respect the chain of command! The Warden outranks you within the brig itself. Obey the Head of Security, but remember that the Captain outranks him.[br]
[*]Remember your priorities: One punch is hardly something to arrest anyone over if there is a hostage situation.[br]
