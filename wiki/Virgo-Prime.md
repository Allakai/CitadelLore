### Summary

Virgo-4, commonly dubbed Virgo Prime, is the only habitable planet in
the [Virgo-Erigone](/wiki/Virgo-Erigone "wikilink") System. It lies right in
the middle of the Goldilocks Zone, has stable tectonics, an active and
decent magnetosphere and a breathable, terran-like atmosphere, primarily
made out of nitrogen, oxygen and traces of carbon dioxide. It would be
optimal for [human](human "wikilink") development, wouldn’t there be
complications.

The first is the cataclysmic event Virgo Prime has suffered through,
rendering most of its surface sterile, salted and arid, while also
having apparently killed most life hundreds of years ago. The result is
a hostile fauna, mutated beyond belief and fiercely adapted to the
broken landscape.

The second complication is the native species living on the planet, the
Zorren. Hardy and prideful about their continued survival, they still
cling to the broken lands and do their best to sheperd it back to its
previous, garden-like state - Although they suffered too from the event
of the past, as their culture, technology and societal structure has
regressed to pre-gunpowder state. Only the ruins, deep within the salt
wastes, infested with radiation and worse, hint of their technological
apex, seemingly on the cusp of reaching FTL-Travel.

Regardless of that, conditions are certainly liveable, if hard. Whether
due to nature taking its course or the stubborn work of the
[Zorren](/wiki/Zorren "wikilink"), some zones of denser vegetation exist,
although fertile lands are coveted and fought over constantly between
the warring families, clans, tribes and monarchies, which make up the
Zorren’s current governments.

### Geography

Virgo Prime’s geography and land features are scarred deeply by the
extinction event they have faced, leaving much of the planetary water
boiled off and escaped out of the atmosphere of the planet, as well the
soil deadened by heat, radiation and salt residue of former oceans.
However, single pockets of soil have survived and while Virgo Prime is
much more arid now, it still retains an active hydrosphere of rain and
snow.

It possesses two polar caps, one south, one north, both primarily made
out of water ice, although the southern cap is mostly swimming in some
of the remaining ocean of Virgo Prime, while the northern cap is
surrounded by dry, cold wastelands.

The surface has suffered from repeated asteroid and meteorite strikes in
the past, leaving large craters and new formations of mountains in its
wake, giving the planet a wild, primal and jagged appearance in many
regions, although continued erosion slowly smoothed these features into
much more manageable geographic features.

Much of the geography is dominated by dry wasteland, regions that have
been ecologically devastated to the point that the soil itself is dry,
caked and infertile. Nothing grows here and only the most hardy animals
dare to cross these barren regions.

A worse form of these wastelands are the salt and glass plains, which
are infested either with residual boil off from former lakes and oceans
or completely crystallized sand deserts from intense asteroid impacts.
Salt plains are usually avoided and occasionally exploited for salt
mining by the Zorren, as they too are infertile and very, very eager to
suck out any moisture of living things. Glass plains are completely
avoided. Apart from the massive heat retention of the glass, making it
basically a frying pan, the glass fragments can be kicked up and create
a deadly glass storm, in which everything within in vicinity is cut up
by millions of glass fragments. Even NT tend to avoid these areas, as
voidsuits and hardsuits only resist these storms for so long.

However, not all features are inherently hostile to life. Hospitable
regions are sparse, but enough to support life, especially along rivers,
ocean coastlines and oases. The most fertile regions are usually along
hillsides and elevated regions who are less suspect to the heavy,
blowing winds.

### Flora and Fauna

The biosphere of Virgo Prime has greatly suffered from its cataclysm and
the original animal and plants have been steadily supplanted by arid
extremophiles, if not completely wiped out in the original disaster.

Many species share extreme hardiness and proficiency to weather long
periods of droughts, saving water in one way or the other.

Flora has it especially hard on Virgo Prime, as much of the water is
either excessively salty or very spare indeed. Thus, the Hihtano Vine
carries extreme importance in many regions of arid wastelands. This
lichen grows abundantly in many regions, covering the floor in its
mottled black-brown stalks, filtering water into large vacuoles in case
of a draught. Serving as both staple food for many herbivores as well as
means to quench one’s thirst, it is also a cultivation crop for the
Highlander Zorren, who use it to feed it their livestock, while the
Flatlanders use wild patches for their shepherding.

Another important plant is the Kithni Shrub, a cultivar of the [Highland
Zorren](/wiki/Zorren "wikilink"). It is a high maintenance crop requiring much
water, while only producing negligible amounts of useful goods, mostly
coarse fiber for clothing - However, the chaff is used as compost and
their roots pack dirt and loose ground into actual soil, reclaiming land
from desertificated areas. Thus, it is often planted on vanguard farms
to increase arable soil.

Curiously enough, a species similar to the Vulpes Zerda lives on Virgo
Prime, primarily hunting smaller insects and scavenging for eggs.
Genetic profiling does reveal only a very tangential relationship
between the Terran fennec and the Virgo fennec, making it a curious case
of convergent evolution.

Virgo Prime’s predator are quite dangerous and they contain several apex
predators, such as the so called Deathclaw, the [Serpentes
Gigantus](/wiki/Serpentes_Gigantus "wikilink") and the [Anura
Gigantus](/wiki/Anura_Gigantus "wikilink"). Each of them prove a constant
obstacle not only for NT expeditions, but also Highlander and Flatlander
Reclamation of their homeworld.

### Important Settlements

The most important settlement for NT interests is the Township of
[Anur](/wiki/Anur "wikilink"). With over four hundred thousand permanent
inhabitants, it is the biggest colony of non-native lifeforms within the
system and focal point of Virgo-Erigone administration.

Beyond that, [Kaz-Zahaden](/wiki/Kaz-Zahaden "wikilink"), the capital of the
Zahaden Clan proves of strategic interest for NT, housing some of their
defense assets due to contract with the noble family.

Other, smaller corporate enclaves exist, but these go not beyond a
hundred people at most, often only temporary and quickly abandoned.

The rest of sapient settlement is strictly native.
