For the aspiring [Roboticist](/wiki/Roboticist "wikilink"), this guide will
explain the creation and maintenance of [Cyborg](/wiki/Cyborg "wikilink"),
Bots, and Mechs.

Cyborgs
=======

**See also [Cyborgification
Contracts](/wiki/Guide_to_Paperwork#Robotics "wikilink").** These contracts
are important - without a signed, stamped contract, making a man into a
machine is technically murder - no matter how much he wants it!

The [Cyborg](/wiki/Cyborg "wikilink") is the Roboticist's primary creation and
upkeep. They are tasked with helping the station's inhabitants in their
daily life and trying to kill everyone when the [AI](/wiki/AI "wikilink") is
insane. Each cyborg is required to follow the AI's laws, and may choose
one of the AIs in the event that more than one exists.

Making a Cyborg
---------------

1.  Fill the ![](Exofab.png "fig:Exofab.png") Exosuit Fabricator with as
    much ![](Metal.png "fig:Metal.png") metal as it will hold.
2.  Click on the Exosuit Fabricator to open its menu. Select **Add all
    parts to queue** beside the **Cyborg** option, and then click
    **Process Queue** in the right sidebar (with a recent update, please
    note that adding "all parts" will print four extra components that
    are only used for repair, not construction).
3.  Wait for a few minutes for the pieces to be built. You will likely
    need to add additional metal to the Fabricator in order for it to
    finish.
4.  When putting the parts together, use the
    ![](Cyborg_endoskeleton.png "fig:Cyborg_endoskeleton.png") Cyborg
    Endoskeleton as a base.
    -   The Cyborg Head will need 2x ![](Flash.png "fig:Flash.png")
        Flash.
    -   The Cyborg Torso will need 1x
        ![](CableCoils.png "fig:CableCoils.png") wires and 1x
        ![](Powercell.png "fig:Powercell.png") power cell.
    -   The arms and legs can be done easily by simply picking them up
        and placing them on the Cyborg Endoskeleton.

### Extract a brain for the Cyborg

**Note:** Check with the Chief Medical Officer before agreeing to
perform a brain extraction on a living human. Medbay has anesthetics,
which are optimal when someone is cutting into your skull with a
circular saw. Additionally, it will clear up bookkeeping problems
regarding the addition of a new cadaver in the morgue.

1.  (Optional) Complete [Prepping for
    Surgery](/wiki/Surgery#Prepping_for_Surgery "wikilink").
2.  Aim for the organ's location in the
    ![](Damage_zone.png "fig:Damage_zone.png") Damage Zone. (Head for
    brain/eyes, chest for heart/liver/lungs, groin for appendix/kidney)
3.  Use a ![](Scalpel.png "fig:Scalpel.png") **scalpel** to cut back the
    flesh.
4.  Use the ![](Hemostat.png "fig:Hemostat.png") **hemostat** to stop
    any potential bleeding.
5.  Use your ![](Retractor.png "fig:Retractor.png") **retractors** to
    lift up the skin.
6.  Use the ![](Saw.png "fig:Saw.png") **saw** to cut through the bones.
7.  Use the ![](Retractor.png "fig:Retractor.png") **retractor** to
    separate the bones.
8.  Use the ![](Scalpel.png "fig:Scalpel.png") **scalpel**. This will
    open up a window asking you which organ you'd like to cut loose.
    Select the Brain.
9.  Use the ![](Hemostat.png "fig:Hemostat.png") *'hemostat*. This will
    open up a window asking you which loose organ you'd like to remove.
    Select the Brain again.
10. Place the brain in an ![](MMI_empty.png "fig:MMI_empty.png") MMI.
11. (Optional) Before you give the Cyborg a new brain, you can name it
    anything you or your client wants. Grab a ![](Pen.png "fig:Pen.png")
    pen and use the pen on the Cyborg to rename it. Once you place the
    brain in the Cyborg, this step will not be completable.
12. Carry the ![](MMI.png "fig:MMI.png") MMI over to your finished
    Cyborg construct that you made before, and click on it to add the
    brain into the Cyborg.

You can also use a normal table instead of an operating table, but this
has a chance of missing one third of the time.

### So You Decapitated Your Patient

Don't panic just yet! You can still complete the brain extraction by
placing their head on the operating table and following the same steps
as above. You should probably apologize to them after putting their
brain in an MMI, though.

Cyborg Maintenance
------------------

You'll often have Cyborgs run up to you with any number of problems.
Here's how to deal with them most of the time.

### Repair

When Cyborgs get dented, they'll come to you for repairs. Luckily, most
repairs are simple:

1.  Equip a ![](WeldingHelmet.png "fig:WeldingHelmet.png") welding
    helmet on your head.
    -   *Note: Be sure to remember this step or you could go blind!*
2.  Place a ![](Welderon.gif "fig:Welderon.gif") welder in your hand,
    click on it while it's in your hand to light it, then click on the
    Cyborg repeatedly to repair it. Engineer cyborgs can also repair
    themselves and other cyborgs like this.

Occasionally Cyborgs are inflicted by more advanced damage that hurts
their internal wiring. If this is the case:

1.  ![](Id_regular.png "fig:Id_regular.png") Swipe an ID with Robotics
    access to unlock the panel.
2.  ![](Crowbar.png "fig:Crowbar.png") Crowbar open the panel.
3.  ![](Power_cell.png "fig:Power_cell.png") Remove the cyborg's power
    cell by clicking on it with an empty hand.
4.  ![](Screwdriver_tool.png "fig:Screwdriver_tool.png") Use a
    screwdriver to expose the wires.
5.  ![](CableCoils.png "fig:CableCoils.png") Use a cable coil to replace
    damaged wires.
6.  ![](Screwdriver_tool.png "fig:Screwdriver_tool.png") Screwdriver the
    cyborg to unexpose the wires.
7.  ![](Power_cell.png "fig:Power_cell.png") Reinsert the power cell by
    clicking on the cyborg.
8.  ![](Crowbar.png "fig:Crowbar.png") Crowbar the panel shut.
9.  ![](Id_regular.png "fig:Id_regular.png") Swipe an ID with Robotics
    access to relock the cover.

### Cyborg Component Repair

Sometimes robots will have damaged components that need to be removed
and replaced. Removing them is pretty straightforward.

1.  ![](Id_regular.png "fig:Id_regular.png") Swipe an ID with Robotics
    access to unlock the panel.
2.  ![](Crowbar.png "fig:Crowbar.png") Crowbar open the panel.
3.  ![](Power_cell.png "fig:Power_cell.png") Remove the cyborg's power
    cell by clicking on it with an empty hand.
4.  ![](Screwdriver_tool.png "fig:Screwdriver_tool.png") Use a
    screwdriver to expose the wires.
5.  ![](Crowbar.png "fig:Crowbar.png") Crowbar out the desired
    component.

Occasionally a robot will be so damaged that only the brain is
salvageable, or perhaps it's volunteering for an AI core. You can remove
the brain by following these steps.

1.  ![](Id_regular.png "fig:Id_regular.png") Swipe an ID with Robotics
    access to unlock the panel.
2.  ![](Crowbar.png "fig:Crowbar.png") Crowbar open the panel.
3.  ![](Power_cell.png "fig:Power_cell.png") Remove the cyborg's power
    cell by clicking on it with an empty hand.
4.  ![](Screwdriver_tool.png "fig:Screwdriver_tool.png") Use a
    screwdriver to expose the wires.
5.  ![](Wirecutters.png "fig:Wirecutters.png") Cut all five wires with
    wirecutters.
6.  ![](Crowbar.png "fig:Crowbar.png") Use a crowbar to remove the MMI.

When finished, be sure to reinsert the power cell into the cyborg and
close them back up with your crowbar.

### Upgrading the Power Cell

Cyborgs that start when the game starts will likely come straight to you
for an upgrade in the first few minutes of the game. Help them out by
upgrading their power cell, which will lessen the amount of time they
need to visit the recharging station. Click on the Cyborg with the
following items (in order):

1.  ![](Id_regular.png "fig:Id_regular.png") Swipe an ID with Robotics
    access to unlock the panel.
2.  ![](Crowbar.png "fig:Crowbar.png") Crowbar open the panel.
3.  Click on the Cyborg with an ![](Empty_hand.png "fig:Empty_hand.png")
    empty hand to take out the ![](Powercell.png "fig:Powercell.png")
    power cell and replace it with the higher-capacity power cell.
    -   *Note: The default power cell capacity in Cyborgs is 7,500. All
        of the power cells you find in your office should be at least
        15,000, and the Science Department can research power cells that
        exceed 30,000.*
4.  ![](Crowbar.png "fig:Crowbar.png") Crowbar the panel shut.
5.  ![](Id_regular.png "fig:Id_regular.png") Swipe an ID with Robotics
    access to relock the cover.

### Resetting Modules

Once a player Cyborg chooses a module (Engineer, Janitor, Security, etc)
they cannot change the module without your help. You can manually reset
its module to allow it the option of choosing a new one by following
this order:

1.  ![](Id_regular.png "fig:Id_regular.png") Swipe an ID with Robotics
    access to unlock the panel.
2.  ![](Crowbar.png "fig:Crowbar.png") Crowbar open the panel.
3.  ![](Robotics_reset_module_circuit.png "fig:Robotics_reset_module_circuit.png")
    Print out a reset upgrade in the fabricator, and insert it into the
    cyborg.
4.  ![](Crowbar.png "fig:Crowbar.png") Crowbar the panel shut.
5.  ![](Id_regular.png "fig:Id_regular.png") Swipe an ID with Robotics
    access to relock the cover.

### Cyborg Upgrades

There are several cyborg upgrade modules that can be printed from the
prosthetics fabricator in Robotics, assuming sufficient research has
been done beforehand. To apply an upgrade, open the cyborgs access panel
and insert the upgrade inside it.

-   **Emergency Restart Module**

` The least expensive way to revive a cyborg that has fully died. After repairing sufficient damage to the cyborgs body, applying this upgrade will reactivate it.`

-   **Reclassification Board**

` When applied, changes the cyborgs name to one chosen by the user. The name is modified by activating the upgrade module inhand.`

-   **Module Reset Board**

` Removes the cyborgs current module, allowing it to reselect a new one.`

-   **VTEC Module**

` Kicks in a cyborgs VTEC systems, allowing them to move faster.`

-   **Rapid Taser Cooling Module**

` Increases the recharge rate of a security module cyborg's taser. Two can be applied before further ones will have no effect.`

-   **Mining Robot Jetpack**

` Despite the name, can be applied to any type of cyborg. Gives the cyborg a CO2-filled jetpack.`

-   **Advanced Health Analyzer Module**

` Gives the cyborg an advanced health analyzer. While it can be applied to any cyborg, it is of limited use to non-medical modules.`

-   **Scrambled Equipment Module**

` Unlocks a cyborg module's hidden equipment, which is normally activated with an emag. These are universally either lethal or disabling weaponry.`

-   **Language Module**

` Allows a cyborg to speak nearly any language, instead of only understanding them. Clerical and Service module cyborgs have this function by default.`

### Modifications

Cyborgs that have had their programming tampered with can be repaired by
resetting their AI connection and LawSync status, by manually pulsing
the wiring. In the unlikely event that an AI goes crazy, a trained
[Roboticist](/wiki/Roboticist "wikilink") or other technician should be able
to sever the connection to the AI entirely by cutting the correct wire.

There are three lights in the cyborg with three corresponding wires:

-   **LawSync**: If this light is on, it means that any laws uploaded to
    the AI are also uploaded to the cyborg. The cyborg cannot be given
    different laws to the AI as long as this is on. This light will turn
    off if the AI Link light is off, regardless of wire status.
    -   *Pulsing* does nothing.
    -   *Cutting* will do nothing, as long as the AI link light is on.
        If the AI link light is off, cutting and then turning the AI
        link back on will cause the cyborg to be slaved to an AI, but
        not synced with it's laws.
    -   *Mending* this wire will turn the LawSync light back on as long
        as the AI link light is also on. The cyborg will then resume
        syncing with the AI's laws. If the AI link light is off, mending
        this will turn the light on, only for it to turn off again.

<!-- -->

-   **AI Link**: If this light is on, it shows that the Cyborg is slaved
    to an AI and must follow that AI's orders.
    -   *Pulsing* this wire allows you to pick an AI for the cyborg to
        be slaved to if there are multiple AIs. If there is only one AI,
        pulsing this will simply turn it on and slave the cyborg to it,
        if it is off.
    -   *Cutting* this wire will cause the Cyborg to be unslaved from
        the AI and bound only by it's laws. This also turns off LawSync,
        as the cyborg has no AI to sync to.
    -   *Mending* this wire does nothing. You need to pulse it to
        reconnect it to an AI.

<!-- -->

-   **Module Lock**: If this light is on, the module of the cyborg
    cannot be changed.
    -   *Pulsing* this will reset the module of a cyborg and allow it to
        pick a new one.
    -   *Cutting* this wire will cause the cyborg to be locked to the
        standard module and be unable to change or use any items. They
        can still remote control devices however.
    -   *Mending* this wire will allow the cyborg to change modules.

An emagged cyborg will have no LawSync or AI link and cannot be reset.

Remember, cyborgs are very expensive! Do not destroy them unless the
cyborg is completely out of control, and resetting the AI and LawSync
status doesn't work.

Synthmorphs
===========

The [Synthmorph](/wiki/Synthmorph "wikilink") is something the Roboticist may
encounter as well. This is essentially a person inside a bipedal
mechanical body. They may have been referred to as **IPC** in the past,
short for *Integrated Positronic Chassis*, though not all favored this
designation. Roboticists are not 'responsible' for these in the same way
they are for Cyborgs, as Synthmorphs are effectively normal people with
a different body. They may play doctor for them, however, as synthmorph
repairs are within the robotics department domain.

Creating a Synthmorph
---------------------

While you can assemble a synthmorph's body, putting a mind in it is a
whole other matter. Moving a previously-lawed entity (cyborg, AI) into a
synthmorph body typically requires paperwork to be completed. Assembling
the body is fairly straight-forward however, assuming you have the
materials:

Most of the work is done at the ![](Bioprinter.png "fig:Bioprinter.png")
Prosthetics Fabricator.

1.  Ensure R&D has performed enough research to allow you to create
    prosthetic torsos, heads, and eyes. You may wish to re-sync the
    Prosthetics Fabricator to make sure you're up to date.
2.  Print all parts of a synthmorph, including torso, both hands and
    feet, both arms and legs, a head, and optical sensors. Make sure to
    select the manufacturer you want ahead of time. If you do not see
    the manufacturer you want, contact Cargo to order you blueprint
    discs.
3.  Place the torso onto a surgical table in robotics, and attach each
    limb one at a time, finishing with the head.
4.  Use a screwdriver, then a crowbar to open the head's maintenance
    panel and install the optical sensors into the head.
5.  At this time, you can also install a brain in an MMI or a Positronic
    Brain. Synthmorphs do not support having a normal organic brain.
6.  Use a crowbar to close the maintenance panel when done.
7.  Congratulations, you've given someone a new lease on life.

Prosthetic/Synthmorph Repair
----------------------------

You may be asked to repair damage to the artificial limbs of your fellow
crew members.

To fix **brute damage**, target the specific area that requires fixing,
and use a welding tool on the area.

To fix **burn damage**, use a cable coil on the damaged area to replace
the melted wiring.

### Internal Repairs

Sometimes the damage to a humanoid with prosthetics or a synthmorph may
be severe enough to require internal repairs. This is akin to requiring
surgery for an organic limb. Follow the steps below to perform these
repairs.

1.  Have the subject **lay flat** on a table, preferably an operating
    table in the robotics lab.
2.  Use a **screwdriver** on the damaged limb to gain access to the
    maintenance panel.
3.  Use a **crowbar** to pry the panel open to gain access to the limb's
    internals.
4.  Apply either **welding** or **cable coils** as needed to the
    internals.
5.  Use the **crowbar** to shut the maintenance panel when done. It will
    latch back into place.

#### Removing Internal Organs

You might sometimes need to remove an organ from the body of a synth.
The most common occurrence of this is removing a MMI or posibrain from a
heavily damaged synth so it can be placed into the newly printed body.
To remove any internal organ in a synth:

1.  Use a **screwdriver** and crowbar to open your patient up.
2.  Use a **multitool** on them, this will bring up a window asking you
    which organ you want to prepare for removal.
3.  Select the organ and hit okay, this will cause a progress bar to
    appear.
4.  Once that bar is filled, you'll be able to use a **hemostat** on the
    patient to bring up a window asking you which organ you want to
    remove.
5.  Select the organ you want and hit okay, then wait for the progress
    bar to finish like before. With the **hemostat** you might have to
    try more than once, but failing 'to grab something' doesn't damage
    the patient.
6.  With that, the organ should be out!

### In A Pinch

Sometimes you might need to get repairs done urgently and lack the usual
tools to do so, or perhaps have one that might help speed things along,
two of which are:

##### Nanopaste

A nanite swarm in a bottle. Has ten uses and heals 20 burn damage and 20
brute damage if the patient is opened up properly. This healing applies
to internal organs as well. If the patient isn't opened, it only does
heals 10 brute and 10 burn damage and doesn't heal internal organs.

##### Screwdriver

If you lack nanopaste, the screwdriver can be used to repair internal
organ damage with a 30% chance of failure which will damage the patient,
so only use this if you lack nanopaste!

And remember: if you lack a surgery table, any old table will do. Using
an ordinary table has a 34% chance of your surgery failing though, so do
try to find a surgery table if possible.

NIF Surgeries for Synthmorphs
-----------------------------

Sometimes you’ll get a synth in who either wants a
[NIF](/wiki/Nanite_implant_framework "wikilink") installed, or one taken out
for repairs. The two surgeries you'll find yourself doing are:

#### NIF Installation

1.  Target the patient’s head and use a screwdriver.
2.  Use a crowbar to open their head up.
3.  Use the surgical drill to create a cavity.
4.  With the NIF in your active hand and the patient’s head still
    targeted, click the patient to place the NIF inside the cavity.
5.  Use a crowbar to close them up again.

Be sure to inform your patient about the after affects of the surgery
before it's done. These effects can be seen
[here](https://wiki.vore-station.net/Nanite_implant_framework#Installing_a_NIF).

#### NIF Maintenance

1.  Target the patient’s head and use a screwdriver.
2.  Use a crowbar to open their head up.
3.  Use the hemostat to get the NIF out (may take more than one
    attempt).
4.  [Repair the
    NIF](https://wiki.vore-station.net/Nanite_implant_framework#Maintaining_the_NIF).
5.  Use the surgical drill to recreate the cavity.
6.  With the NIF in your active hand and the patient’s head still
    targeted, click the patient to place the NIF inside the cavity.
7.  Use a crowbar to close them up again.

Resleeving a Synthmorph
-----------------------

Synths can be resleeved using the resleeving console next to the
SynthFab 3000 machine. The SynthFab machine itself requires metal and
glass to function (though it comes with an amount already provided) and
the synth must have received a backup implant previously in the shift
for their mind to be present in the database.

If both a body and mind backup are present, a roboticist can follow the
[Guide to Resleeving](/wiki/Guide_to_Resleeving "wikilink") to resleeve the
synth.

Bots
====

As a Roboticist, you serve another important purpose, making NPC robots.
Robots can benefit the station in many ways, and are really easy to
create. The current list of robots, and how to make them, is as follows:

![](Medibot.gif "fig:Medibot.gif") Medibot
------------------------------------------

These will only inject chemicals if the chemical helps with the target's
damage by default. They can also be
[Emagged](/wiki/Syndicate_Items#Electromagnetic_Card "wikilink") to repeatedly
inject anyone with harmful chemicals. Note that these have a very
limited selection of medicines by default: Tricordrazine for all damage,
and Spaceaccilin for detected Viruses.

Combine the following ingredients in order:

1.  Start with an Empty ![](SMed.png "fig:SMed.png") Medkit.
    -   *Note: Differently colored medkits will also change the
        resulting color of your Medibot.*
2.  (Optional) Name the bot with a ![](Pen.png "fig:Pen.png") pen.
3.  Add a Cyborg Right or Left Arm.
4.  Add a
    Health![](Healthanalyzer.png "fig:Healthanalyzer.png")Analyzer.
5.  Add a
    Proximity![](Proximitysensor.png "fig:Proximitysensor.png")Sensor.
6.  (Optional) Add a![](Beaker.png "fig:Beaker.png")beaker filled with
    the medicine of your choice.

![](Cleanbot.gif "fig:Cleanbot.gif") Cleanbot
---------------------------------------------

Cleanbots are great, as they serve the exact same purpose as the
Janitor. Even better is that it uses Space Cleaner to mop, so no
slipping on everything!

1.  ![](Bucket.png "fig:Bucket.png") bucket (Grab it from the
    [Janitor](/wiki/Janitor "wikilink") or make with
    [Autolathe](/wiki/Autolathe "wikilink"))
2.  ![](Proximitysensor.png "fig:Proximitysensor.png") proximity sensor.
3.  (Optional) Name the bot with a ![](Pen.png "fig:Pen.png") pen.
4.  Cyborg Right or Left Arm.

![](Farmbot.png "fig:Farmbot.png") Farmbot
------------------------------------------

1.  ![](Watertank.png "fig:Watertank.png") on a watertank, use:
2.  Prosthetic Right or Left Arm;
3.  ![](Plant_analyzer.png "fig:Plant_analyzer.png") Plant analyser;
4.  ![](Bucket.png "fig:Bucket.png") Bucket;
5.  ![](Minihoe.png "fig:Minihoe.png") Mini hoe;
6.  ![](Proximitysensor.png "fig:Proximitysensor.png") proximity sensor.

![](Floorbot.gif "fig:Floorbot.gif") Floorbot
---------------------------------------------

Floorbots are nice to have around when some asshole starts crowbarring
up floor tiles or some traitor has blown apart a section of the station.
They zoom around and repair busted floor tiles. To make:

1.  Empty ![](btoolbox.png "fig:btoolbox.png") toolbox (Must be a blue
    one)
2.  ![](Floor_Tiles.png "fig:Floor_Tiles.png") Floor tile (click on a
    stack of metal while it's in your hand to open a menu for making
    these)
3.  ![](Proximitysensor.png "fig:Proximitysensor.png") proximity sensor.
4.  (Optional) Name the bot with a ![](Pen.png "fig:Pen.png") pen.
5.  Cyborg Right or Left Arm.

Keep in mind that Floorbots have a limited number of floor tiles. This
number can be observed by popping up their control panel.

![I AM THE LAW](Securitron.gif "fig:I AM THE LAW") Securitron
-------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, Officer Beepsky without the personality. You usually won't
need to build any of these, but they can be hilariously helpful for
traitors whom have invested in a [Electromagnetic
Card](/wiki/Syndicate_Items#Electromagnetic_Card "wikilink"), as they tend to
run around stunning and cuffing everyone in sight. Problem is, any of
these that report a Level 10 Infraction when spotting people are
obviously hacked. To make:

-   Use a [Screwdriver](/wiki/Screwdriver "wikilink") on a [Remote Signaling
    Device](/wiki/Remote_Signaling_Device "wikilink")
-   Combine with a [Helmet](/wiki/Helmet "wikilink") (Get these from Security)
-   [Hand Welder](/wiki/Welding_Tool "wikilink") them together
-   Add a [Proximity Sensor](/wiki/Proximity_Sensor "wikilink") and a Robot
    Arm
-   Toss in a [Stun Baton](/wiki/Stun_Baton "wikilink") (or use a Slime Baton
    to make the xenobio helpful version, i really need to find what the
    name is)

Note that destroying a Securitron or Officer Beepsky with a melee weapon
is all but impossible by yourself; striking them causes them to
immediately stun and cuff you. If you work with another person you can
get several hits in while it is cuffing the other person, which is often
enough to destroy it outright.

![](ED209.png "fig:ED209.png") ED-209
-------------------------------------

Beepsky's bigger brother. Has all of the abilities of a standard
Securitron with the addition of a ranged attack. To make:

-   Use a [metal sheet](metal_sheet "wikilink") on a Cyborg Endoskeleton
    to reinforce it.
-   Add two Robot Legs and a [security vest](security_vest "wikilink")
-   [Weld](/wiki/Welding_Tool "wikilink") everything together
-   Add in a security [Helmet](/wiki/Helmet "wikilink")
-   Attach a [Proximity Sensor](/wiki/Proximity_Sensor "wikilink") to the
    assembly
-   Insert wires
-   Add a [Taser](/wiki/Taser "wikilink") and attach it with a
    [Screwdriver](/wiki/Screwdriver "wikilink")
-   Insert a [Power cell](/wiki/Power_cell "wikilink"). Your own mecha is
    complete!

A emagged ED-209 fires deadly lasers AND attacks anyone on sight.

Spiderbot
---------

Spiderbots are temporary bodies for brains. They can carry around small
items, zap things, move through vents and generally act like pests.

Combine the following:

-   Robot head.
-   Manipulator.
-   Occupied MMI or positronic brain.

Mechs
=====

Construction of mechs are restricted by ID, so they are typically the
product of [roboticists](roboticist "wikilink") and the [Research
Director](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink"). These can be tremendously
helpful or tremendously annoying depending on who uses it. They take
more work to make than robots and require special circuits, which are
obtained through the [Quartermaster](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink") or the
Research and Development console.

The current list of mechs is as follows.

Ripley APLU
-----------

<img src="Ripley.png" title="fig:Ripley.png" alt="Ripley.png" width="64" />  
The Ripley APLU (Autonomous Power Loading Unit) is a slow moving,
decently protected mech. Generally, it can take down a Gygax because of
the sheer power of the drill, but it does not make a good combat mech
because it is slow and has no range. Best used against Spess carp
invasions, blobs, Changelings, and for Revs (using it to breach high
security areas)

To make:

-   Build all of the Ripley parts using the exosuit fabricator.
-   Build a Hydraulic Clamp and Drill
-   Attach all of the parts to the Ripley chassis (Except the Clamp and
    Drill)
-   [Wrench](/wiki/Wrench "wikilink")

Mech Equipment
--------------

Various tools and weapons can be attached to mechs, providng them with
ability to perform different tasks. Mech Equipment is built by Mech
Fabricator ("Exosuit Equipment" menu). To attach a tool or weapon,
simply click with it on mecha. Most mechs can hold no more than three
equipment pieces.

**Drill**  
The drill can completely destroy most objects (with the exception of
reinforced walls) in a few seconds. Using the drill on someone will gib
them in a few seconds. So don't do that unless you're a traitor.

When used for mining, targeted and two adjacent mineral deposits will be
drilled. If Ripley exosuit is equipped with Hydraulic Clamp and has an
Ore Box in cargo, all mined ore will be moved to Ore Box.  
(Can be attached to: **RIPLEY**)

**Diamond Drill**  
Essentially an upgraded drill. Isn't any stronger, but it is faster (all
you need for mining really). Bug R&D to sync their servers and in no
time mining can obliterate the asteroid (provided that they bring you
diamonds first)

Centcomm mechs. You know you want to just hijack the deathsquad shuttles
after taking their IDs off their burnt corpses, charge out the doors
with your stolen weapons in hand, hack your way through the
multitudinous doors as more security rushes in with murder in mind and
pulse cannons and power armour at hand, until you finally get to your
prizes, the mech bay - only to steal the teleporters mounted on them and
scarper back to the station to use them in the destructive analyser. You
know it's what you want to do. Do it. Do it. Do it.)
