Squeaky Squeak
--------------

If you're a [Ghost](/wiki/Ghost "wikilink"), either from dying or being an
observer, you can choose to become a mouse.

Please note that becoming a mouse resets the drone timer and the respawn
timer.

There's not much to do unfortunately, as you can't interact with
anything. Still, you can communicate with other mice, crawl through
vents, and maybe go on quests for cheese!

You'll usually spawn near a random vent. It's best to stay near vents,
as they act as a quick escape method in case you are being chased by a
cat/crewmember.

As a mouse you are able to hide under some tables, but fax machines and
some computers somehow stop your little mousely body from crawling
underneath them. Use the "Hide" verb to go under tables. While you *can*
eat a piece of cheese through a table, please RP correctly and unhide
while you are eating cheese on top of a table.

How to RP as a Mouse
--------------------

Do you think that you should follow people without hiding and annoy them
for fun? NO!

You are just a simple RODENT. You must HIDE even if you do FOLLOW.
Humans have large deadly feet, mousetraps, and pet cats. They are very
dangerous!

Dangers
-------

You can be instantly killed by mousetraps, cats, or being stomped on.
The life of a mouse is fraught with dangers! Don't forget, hiding is
your best friend.

Return To The Dead
------------------

It's possible to return to ghost form by using the "Ghost" verb.
