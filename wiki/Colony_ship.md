A colony ship is a popular type of landing vessel used by both corporate
and military organizations. All colony ships are equipped with what is
called a colony starter unit, which is a vehicle containing everything
needed to jump-start a colony on a newly discovered alien world. All
colony starter units come with basics like a year's worth of rations, as
well as everything that should be needed to construct and maintain
self-sufficiency before rations run out. Using 3D printers, a colony
starter unit is able to turn raw materials into any tools programmed
into its database, like a giant [Autolathe](/wiki/Autolathe "wikilink").

The [USDF](/wiki/USDF "wikilink") famously uses mother ships like the
Phoenix-class colony ship to carry up to ten colony starter units at
once. However, it is possible to purchase individual colony starter
units equipped with [FTL](/wiki/FTL "wikilink") drives. The advantage of a
mother ship is the ability to launch multiple colony starter units at
once without having to spend the resources for an FTL drive on each
unit, nor the [fuel](/wiki/Phoron "wikilink") costs of supplying those drives,
plus a mother ship can provide additional supplies to the colony starter
unit once it has landed. On the other hand, using individual colony
starter ships equipped with FTL drives is far less cost prohibitive,
allowing [Trans-Stellar
corporations](/wiki/List_of_Trans-Stellar_Corporations "wikilink") such as
[NanoTrasen](/wiki/NanoTrasen "wikilink") to make use of colony starter units
when claiming new territories.

Once a colony starter unit makes landfall, it is not intended to take
off again, but rather it is meant to help establish a secure footing on
the new world.

Colony ships are shamelessly stolen from Halo.
