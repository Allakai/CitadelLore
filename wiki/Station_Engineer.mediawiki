As a '''Station Engineer''' you are the man that, when called, fixes a broken light bulb, repairs a door, or, rarely, helps break into a rogue AI's core. You watch over the engine, ensure the electrical machinery aboard the station is up and running, and, most of all, repair the station when it inevitably explodes due to [[Griefer|unforeseen]] [[Guide to Toxins|consequences]].

== Equipment ==
You start in [[Engineering]] with a [[Safety_helmet|Hard Hat]], a [[T-Ray Scanner]], a [[Headset|Engineering Headset]], an [[jumpsuit|Engineering Jumpsuit]], [[Storage_items#Tool_Belt|Tool Belt]] and an [[PDA|Engineering PDA]].

Items that are recommended for Station Engineers include [[Utility Belts|utility belts]], [[Multitool|multitools]], [[Welding Helmet|a welding helmet]], [[Optical Meson Scanner|optical meson scanners]], and [[Cable Coils|cabling]], as well as the [[hazard vest]]. You are also the only people authorised to use [[insulated gloves]].

Utility belts allow for the storage of tools and other such items in your belt slot, freeing your hands up. The multitool is a nifty piece of kit, used <s>in the [[hacking]] of doors</s> for checking the amount of power flowing through wires, and not for any kind of illegal activity what-so-ever. The welding mask is vital to protect your eyes while welding and provides the secondary benefit of protecting from [[flashes]]. The optical meson scanner enables you to see station structure and lighting through obstructions so that you always know where you're going and what's damaged without having to accidentally walk into a vacuum-exposed corridor to do it. Cable coils are used while laying new power lines and completing a few constructions; while not always needed, it is best to carry some with you. Hazard vests are bright orange and it enables an engineer to wear an [[emergency oxygen tank]] in the suit storage slot, freeing the belt slot for the utility belt.

It is also recommended that you carry a stack of [[metal]] and [[glass]] with you in your backpack at all times. This will allow you to respond quickly to any station damage that may occur. All this gear can be obtained in the Engineering locker room, in the top right corner of the Engine Room. If all the metal and glass is gone more can be obtained from the [[Quartermaster]] in the Cargo Bay.

== Doing Your Duty ==
You have a few things you should do, if you don't want to be [[robust]]ed, before doing what you want to do. Repairing things is what engineers do, and so is setting the station with power. Without any engineers doing a little work, the station will crumble.

=== Starting the Engine ===
This is an extremely important task. Luckily, it is [[Supermatter Engine|very simple]]. Make certain you follow the instructions precisely; an engineer who accidentally '''floods Engineering with phoron''' is not a popular person.

=== Working the Solars ===
{{Main|Solars}}
Read the guide, make sure you have wire, internals and a space suit. Best of luck.

=== Fixing the Station ===
If there is, indeed, a breach, a broken door, or some other problem you can fix, you can go ahead and do so. See [[Construction]] for more details.

=== Power Management ===
Remember that you can use your ID on the Power Monitoring Computer to remotely controls APCs. In the event that your power sources run dry, it may be worth turning off a few unneeded APCs. It is also a good idea to set up [[substations]], to prevent widespread power cuts if the main source of power is damaged.
Read the guide for more information.

==Predding==
As an engineer, you have easy access to tools! These tools can be used for getting into the room of whoever you want to eat! Alternatively, you can use remote signalers to bolt down a room with a single button!

==Preying==
As an engineer, you're given a lot of free time after you set up the power. Be sure to get scanned, unless you're strictly an endo prey, or else you might have a [[vore|fun time]]!
