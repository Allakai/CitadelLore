**Personal AI**s are players, like you! They're player-controlled, and
are pulled from all active [Ghosts](/wiki/Ghost "wikilink") in the round. They
have little to no control over the station and have hardly any
responsibilities. Great for new players or those who are new to the
station.

Finally, a friend!
------------------

Personal AIs, or **pAI** for short, are potentially the one individual
you can truly count on. They are similar to a
[carded](/wiki/Intelicard "wikilink") AI, in that they fit in your pocket and
don't really possess much of a body of their own outside of an immobile
device you carry around. However, they cannot wirelessly control doors
and machines around them like a carded AI can. Instead, they possess a
[unique suite of abilities](#pAI_Software "wikilink") with which they
might serve their master. Whom they serve is determined at the DNA
level, allowing whoever holds an unbound pAI device to imprint their own
[unique enzymes](/wiki/Guide_to_genetics "wikilink") to the device. The only
way to unbind a pAI from its master is to wipe the personality
completely, which resets the DNA imprint and makes the device a blank
slate once more.

How to Get One
--------------

Three pAI devices are placed on the map at the beginning of every round.
One can be found in the Crew Quarters, another in the Research
Director's Office, and a third is on the Derelict Station. If all of
those are already taken, R&D can create more by going down the
programming research path. They are inexpensive to produce, requiring
only Programming 3 and 500 glass and metal.

How to Use One
--------------

Pick up the device with an empty hand. Click it again while it's in your
active hand. Search for personalities in the window that appears. This
will send out a request to all active ghosts/observers in-game. After
some time, usually 30 seconds to 2 minutes, they will submit their pAI
personality details. You will receive an update from your pAI device
every time a new personality becomes available. To download a new
personality, simply go through the steps to search for a personality and
select the one you like the best. You now have a pAI!

### Dealing with an Unsatisfactory pAI

Sometimes things just don't work out. Maybe the personality you chose
doesn't fit your playstyle. Maybe the player playing the pAI has
unexpectedly disconnected. Maybe the pAI is being intentionally
antagonistic, ignoring directives, or interpreting them in a way you
don't appreciate. The solution is simple: wipe the personality. This can
be done in much the same way you downloaded it to begin with. Simply
choose "Wipe Personality" in the device settings window. Now the device
is free of the old personality and a new one can be requested as normal.
This forcibly ghosts the player playing the wiped pAI, and allows them
to observe the round as normal (they are capable of re-applying to be a
pAI as well.)

How to Be One
-------------

Only ghosts with active, logged-in clients receive the request to be a
pAI. When someone wants a pAI, you will receive a yes/no dialog box
asking if you want to be one. Answer yes, and in the following window
that appears fill out any information you feel necessary (name is all
that's really required here, the rest is optional). Hit "Submit
Personality" when you're done. Your personality has now been added to
the list of available pAI personalities users may choose from. If
someone likes what you wrote, they'll download you and you'll be placed
inside the device as a new personality.

It's fairly okay to say that you would like to become a pAI in OOC. Just
don't spam up the chat with it.

| Directives               | Shows who your master is (if any), allows you to ask for a DNA sample from whoever is carrying you to verify their identity, and also shows your directives. Your primary directive defaults to "Serve your master". Secondary directives are decided by whoever is carrying you. Interpretation of these directives is intentionally left loose, though [guidelines](#Directive_Guidelines "wikilink") are provided. | 0           |
| Radio Configuration      | pAIs come standard equipped with a single radio tuned in, by default, to the station general channel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 0           |
| Remote Signaler          | This module works similarly to a Remote Signaling Device. You now have the ability to send signals to things such as bombs or hacked equipment. Toxins Researchers would find this useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 5           |
| Crew Manifest            | Lists all known crew members' first and last names, as well as what occupation they're registered as in the station records.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 5           |
| Digital Messenger        | Allows you to send PDA messages. Now you can REALLY be a personal secretary, sending messages for your master!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 5           |
| Medical Records          | Just what it says on the tin. This module allows you to monitor the medical records of the station, and check their current status (as if anyone ever updates the medical records) It's strictly read-only.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 15          |
| Security Records         | Lists the security records of the station for your purview. Works just like the computer. Strictly read-only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 15          |
| Door Jack                | The only real physical influence the pAI has on the world. Enables the pAI to drop a data cable, which can be plugged in to any door. Once plugged in, the pAI can initiate a door jack, which immediately alerts any active station AIs and takes a fairly long time to complete. After the door jacking is completed the door opens.                                                                                | 30          |
| Atmospheric Sensor       | This module works much like the handheld Atmospheric Analyzer seldom carried by Atmos tech and never by the crew. It allows you to get a readout on the air around you. Possibly useful for a Atmos Tech pAI.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 5           |
| Facial Recognition Suite | Functions like the security HUD, showing you who (if any) in sight is a wanted felon. You master cannot see the HUD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 20          |
| Medical Analysis Suite   | After downloading this module, you can use your advanced sensors to continuously monitor the health of everyone around you. Basically, a Medical HUD in computer form, since it works just about the same. You master cannot see the HUD. Additionally, you can perform an advanced health-scan on your carrier, as if you had the Medical Analyzer item equipped.                                                    | 20          |
| Universal Translator     | Allows you to understand anything said by any creature. Does not affect your master.
