A list of commonly-used terms and phrases that you might hear on the
server or on our [forums](http://baystation12.net/forums/index.php).

### Admin

Short for [Administrator](/wiki/Administrator "wikilink"). They have (usually)
red-orange [OOC](/wiki/OOC "wikilink") text and enforce server rules and
behaviour. They have powers designed to keep the game fun for everyone.
Listening to them is a good idea.

[Moderators](/wiki/Moderators "wikilink") also have a similar job, but have
slightly paler blue OOC text, and do not have the powers that admins do.

### Adminhelp

A command which lets you send a message to the admins. Use this (**AND
NOT OOC**) if you think someone is griefing. It should be noted that
even when no admins are online, any messages sent in adminhelp are
logged and also sent to IRC.

### AI

The Artificial Intelligence, the station's computer which can access
machinery on the station. A [job](/wiki/AI "wikilink") that can be played.

### Analyzer

Most often refers to [Health analyzers](/wiki/Health_analyzer "wikilink"), but
can also refer to [Atmospheric Analyzers](/wiki/Analyzer "wikilink"),
[Botany](/wiki/Botanist "wikilink")'s Plant analyzers, or [Research &
Development](/wiki/Scientist "wikilink")'s Destructive analyzer.

### Atmos

Either an [Atmospheric Technician](/wiki/Atmospheric_Technician "wikilink")
(which are also commonly known as Atmos Techs) or the Atmospherics area
itself which deals with the air supply.

### Beepsky/Officer Beepsky

A [securitron](/wiki/Roboticist#Securitron "wikilink") that starts in
Security. Will chase, stun, and handcuff anyone set to be arrested in
the security records.

### Blob

Can refer to the [Blob](/wiki/Blob "wikilink") game mode, or the Blob that
spawns in Blob mode and sometimes in random events. A big green jelly
thing which spreads quickly, consumes oxygen to grow, causes enormous
damage, hurts people, and has variable weaknesses and strengths.

### Bolt/Bolted

A feature of [Airlocks](/wiki/Airlock "wikilink"). When the bolts are dropped,
the door cannot move from its current position, be it open or closed.
They can be lifted by the AI or by [hacking](hacking "wikilink") the
airlock.

### Bridge

The command center of the station. Found in the center of the station.

### Brig

An area of the station with cells and a common holding area, where
people are held by [Security](/wiki/Security "wikilink").

### BYOND

The platform SS13 was coded on. You need it to be able to play the game.

### CentCom

Short for "Central Command", the administration branch of NanoTrasen
which runs the station. Will periodically send messages to the station
which are usually of debatable usefulness. Also refers to the area the
Emergency [Escape Shuttle](/wiki/Escape_Shuttle "wikilink") goes to when it
leaves.

### CO2

Carbon Dioxide, an invisible gas kept in black canisters. Will knock you
out and suffocate you. A small trace amount of it makes up breathable
air.

### Crew

Everyone listed on the Crew Manifest. Hired by NanoTrasen to do their
[Jobs](/wiki/Jobs "wikilink").

### Cryo

The big green glass things in Medbay. They are used to freeze dying
people when treatment must be delayed, to deal with genetic damage, and
to finish new clones.

### Cult

Refers to the [Cult](/wiki/Cult "wikilink") game mode. Or a gimmick by the
[Chaplain](/wiki/Chaplain "wikilink").

say command. Can only be seen by other dead players.

### Disk

The [Nuclear Authentication
Disk](/wiki/Nuclear_Authentication_Disk "wikilink"), used in [Nuclear
Mode](nuke "wikilink").

### Emag

Another name for the [Cryptographic
Sequencer](/wiki/Syndicate_Items#Cryptographic_Sequencer "wikilink") traitor
item, which forces doors open or does other things like letting you
[order](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink") more traitor items.

### Electrify

Another feature of airlocks. If an electrified airlock is touched by
someone without insulated gloves, they will receive an electric shock,
burning their hands and arms and being stunned for a short time. The AI
and Airlock hacking can activate or disable electrification. Some
grilles are also electrified - cutting a cable without wearing insulated
gloves will also electrify you.

### Engine

The large area in the south of the ship which should contain the
[Supermatter](/wiki/Supermatter "wikilink").

### ERP

Erotic Role-Play, also known as "cybering", and the reason most of you
are here. This is allowed on Vorestation.

### EVA

A room just southwest of the Security wing where space suits, jetpacks,
and supplies for repairing breaches are kept. Stands for Extra-Vehicular
Activity.

### Ghost

Refers to a command you can type when you have died to become a ghost,
and to the actual ghosts themselves. Ghosts can speak on deadchat, move
around the station freely, see everything, and can't interact with
anything meaningfully. They are used to observe the game after you have
died or if you log on as an observer. Cannot be seen directly by living
players, except in special circumstances in [Cult](/wiki/Cult "wikilink")

people, livestock, monkeys, and cyborgs exploding.

### Gimmick

Can refer to a player gimmick or a gimmick round. Basically a round or
player which plays with a certain "theme". Can be amusing once or twice
but doing this regularly runs it into the ground very quickly.

### Griefing

*(AKA Griefing/Griefer)*

Griefing is the act of getting enjoyment out of ruining the game for
others. Examples include killing without good reason, randomly starting
fires, dismantling the hull, acting insane to the extent that it
negatively affects others, etc. Note that it can be easy to confuse
[Syndicate](/wiki/Syndicate "wikilink") operatives or the
[Traitor](/wiki/Traitor "wikilink") with griefers. Griefing is a bannable
offense and more rigorously enforced on Vorestation than on most other
SS13 servers.

### [Hacking](/wiki/Hacking "wikilink")

The act of breaking the security measures on equipment such as Airlocks
or APCs by illicit means.

### [HoP](/wiki/Head_of_Personnel "wikilink")

but usually ends up as a secondary Captain.

### [RD](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink")

[Research Director](/wiki/Research_Director "wikilink").

### [HoS](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink")

[Head of Security](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink").

### Hulk

The [superpower](genetics "wikilink"), or a person in possession of it.
People with the Hulk gene turn green and become super strong, being able
to punch through walls, windows, and other fixtures. Hurts like hell if
one hits you. Genetics is no longer active, so Hulks are now rare and
Admins are usually involved in their creation.

### IC in OOC (Icky Ocky)

The act of describing anything happening in the game over the OOC
channel. The rule of thumb is if a person not involved in the incident
or not observing the game can still tell what's going on, it's IC in
OOC. Excessive use usually results in a ban. (See the
[Rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink") page for details.)

### In Character

**In Character** knowledge/chat, often abbreviated to IC, is what you as
the character know or say. It's the opposite of out of character. For
example, a [Chemist](/wiki/Chemist "wikilink") would know how to make
thermite, but not how to start the [Engine](/wiki/Engine "wikilink"). IC
knowledge often differs from [Out of
Character](/wiki/Out_of_Character "wikilink") knowledge. See also:
[Roleplaying](/wiki/Roleplaying "wikilink").

### Internals

Usually an oxygen tank of some sort and a gasmask. Basically any worn
item that lets you breathe when the atmosphere is bad or absent.

### Lag

Concept common to almost all online gaming. Not worth explaining in
depth here - basically it's the server (server-side lag) or your own
computer (client-side lag) being slow and causing noticeable gaps
between you doing stuff and it actually happening in-game. Lag is often
associated with a bomb or a breach, since handling the atmospheric
simulation takes a lot of processing power.

### Law/Laws

Rules which the [AI](/wiki/AI "wikilink") and [Cyborgs](Cyborg "wikilink")
must follow. Are somewhat open to interpretation by the player, and
differ in interpretation by the AI's personality, but the majority
consensus and admin rulings are what really count. May be modified or
changed at an [AI Upload Terminal](/wiki/AI_Upload "wikilink") using various
modules, wiped back to the basics using the Reset Module, or purged
entirely with the Purge Module. Note that core modules cannot be removed
by the standard reset module.

### Lockdown

Refers to individual, local fire alarms locking down areas, places with
shutters, or the bolting down of all doors to an area.

### Mass Driver

The computer or switch operated devices found in Toxins and the Chapel.
Any objects on them when they are activated will be thrown forward at
high speed, either into the bomb testing area (Toxins) or space
(Chapel).

### [Metagaming](/wiki/Metagaming "wikilink")

Metagaming is the act of using out of character knowledge to further
your own player in the game, and is the opposite of Roleplaying. An
example of metagaming would be calling the emergency shuttle at the
beginning of a round to try to find out what round type it is, or doing
things your character should not know how to do, like a surgeon with no
skill in construction or electronics hacking an airlock. This is a
bannable offence.

### Mod

Short for [Moderators](/wiki/Moderators "wikilink") who help deal with various
issues, but are ranked lower than admins.

### Notes

A command which displays "Notes" kept in your characters memory, which
you add with the "add note" command. Some notes are automatically added
depending on the circumstances, such as revolutionaries having the list
of rev members memorized, traitors having their radio frequency
memorized, and Syndicate leaders having the nuclear bomb code memorized.

### N2

Nitrogen, an invisible gas kept in red canisters. Inert, but makes up a
certain percentage of breathable air. Not to be confused with chemical
reagent nitrogen from chemistry.

### N2O

Nitrous Oxide, also known as laughing gas or anesthetic. White gas kept
in red canisters with a white stripe, that will knock you out and
suffocate you at high enough concentrations.

### NanoTrasen

**NanoTrasen** is one of the largest corporations in all of known space.
On our station you work for [NanoTrasen](/wiki/NanoTrasen "wikilink") as an
employee. Unless your character has a believable reason otherwise.

### [NIF](/wiki/Nanite_implant_framework "wikilink")

The Nanite Implant Framework ("NIF") is a sophisticated implant designed
to provide features over the span of several shifts. It's a piece of
equipemnt you can buy IC to give your character special ability's
through the use of software.

### Nuke

Can refer to either the Nuclear game mode, or the Nuclear Fission
Explosive used in said mode. **NOTE: This mode is only play'd during
events. This should never come up during normal rounds.**

### O2

Oxygen. Invisible gas usually kept in blue and white canisters. Vital
for reasons that you should already know, but deadly for reasons you
[may not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity).

### Out of Character

**Out of character** knowledge/chat, often abbreviated to OOC, is what
you as the user know or say. The opposite of in character. For example,
you might play a chemist, but know how to start the engine. Discussing
in character things in OOC chat or using OOC knowledge to get the jump
on someone are examples of [Metagaming](/wiki/Metagaming "wikilink"). OOC
knowledge often differs from In Character knowledge. For the command
see: [OOC](/wiki/Commands#OOC "wikilink").

### OOC in IC (Ocky Icky)

The inverse of the much more common 'IC in OOC'. Whenever a game
mechanic, metafeature, or player-to-player conversation is referenced in
the say or emote channels. Or using ((brackets)) to talk to players
locally OOC. Not recommended.

### PDA

Handheld devices that act as pagers and flashlights and have other
useful functions depending on what cartridge is inserted.

### Phoron

A.K.A. Biotoxin. Purple gas kept in orange canisters. Poisonous and
flammable. Research into uses and properties of plasma is the station's
prime reason for existence, according to the
[backstory](backstory "wikilink"). Used to be called Plasma.

### Pray

Ask the gods for help when no one else can help you. What this really
does is ping the admins with an in-character request for divine help. If
the admins are in a good mood, they might help you, and it's all IC even
if it doesn't make sense. Basically, it's allowed admin abuse.

### [Radio](/wiki/Radio "wikilink")

Normally refers to the headset on your head which can be used with the
command '`say ";Hello everyone!"`', for example. Can also refer to
station bounced radios and intercoms. Shows up as green text with a
symbol and frequency appended to it. Additional department-specific
radios also exsist. To use the equipped department radio's default
department frequency use '`say ":h Hello Department!"`'. (See
[Radio](/wiki/Radio "wikilink") for details or how to use the radio when it
has multiple department frequencies available)

### RCD

[Rapid Construction Device](/wiki/Rapid_Construction_Device "wikilink"). A
piece of equipment which can quickly make and break floors, walls, and
airlocks. Can't break reinforced walls.

### Records

Comes in three flavors, Security, Medical, and Employment, all
accessible from terminals. Can be set during character setup, and both
contain other useful information such as DNA, fingerprint information,
and Security Records that can be used to have
[Beepsky](securitron "wikilink") arrest people on sight.

### Report/Centcom Report/Traitor Report

A document printed out from communications consoles at the start of most
[game modes](/wiki/Game_Mode "wikilink"). Lists who might be the traitor and
what might be their targets. Inaccurate to the point where it's usually
false. Do not treat this report as proof of guilt.

### Resurrection

See [Revive](/wiki/Terminology#Revive "wikilink").

### Rev

Could refer either to the game mode
[Revolution](/wiki/Game_Modes#Revolution "wikilink"), or a member of the
Revolution in said game mode.

### Revive

Bringing someone back to life after they have died through either
[Genetics](/wiki/Genetics "wikilink"), [Robotics](Robotics "wikilink"), or
admin powers.

### [Robust/Robusting](/wiki/Robusting "wikilink")

The game's ROBUST COMBAT SYSTEM. To robust someone is to fight someone
or to win in a fight. To be robust means you often win fights. Fighting
without reason is considered griefing.

### Roleplaying

Roleplaying is the act of pretending to be your character, and is the
opposite of [Metagaming](/wiki/Metagaming "wikilink"). This entails acting as
if the events on the station are real.

See also: [A Crash Course In
Roleplaying](/wiki/A_Crash_Course_In_Roleplaying "wikilink").

### Shuttle

Most of the time refers to the Emergency [Escape
Shuttle](/wiki/Escape_Shuttle "wikilink") or Transfer Shuttle which shows up
at the end of the round near the Escape Arm. Can also refer to the
Arrival Shuttle (where you start if you join late), the
[syndicate](syndicate "wikilink") or [wizard](wizard "wikilink") shuttle
(which you'll rarely see, if ever), the Supply Shuttle (which brings
items to the [Cargo Bay](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink")), or the mining and
research shuttles (which move people between the station and the
asteroid).

### Signal

A beep sent from a [Remote Signaling
Device](/wiki/Remote_Signaling_Device "wikilink"). "Default Signal" is used to
refer to the default setting of the devices, which is Frequency 147.9,
Code 30.

### Signs

Wet Floor Signs. [Janitors](/wiki/Janitor "wikilink") should put these down
where they've mopped.

### [Soulcatcher](/wiki/Nanite_implant_framework#Soulcatcher "wikilink")

**NB:** This does not mean 'metaphysical magical energy', it's just the
name. This NIF Software is designed to preserve minds in case of
emergency,.

### SS13

[Space Station 13](https://spacestation13.com/).

### Syndicate

Mechanically, Syndicate operatives appear in Traitor and
[Nuke](/wiki/Game_Modes#Nuke "wikilink") rounds; however, in the lore, there
is no such organization as "the Syndicate". There are rival companies,
criminal organizations, and mercenary groups, but if you refer to "the
Syndicate", most characters will usually reply, "What kind of a
syndicate?" or, "Who's that?"

Also referred to as 'Syndie' or 'Synd', though don't use that in-game.

See also: [Nuke (game mode)](/wiki/Game_Modes#Nuclear "wikilink")

### Tabling

The act of grabbing, and then placing someone onto a table to instantly
knock them down on it. Useful to incapacitate them briefly, to put them
on the table for surgery, or to help them across the table when they
can't climb across on their own.

### Tele

While usually referring to the hand teleporter, it could also be
referring to the full-fledged teleporter in the [teleporter
room](/wiki/Teleporter "wikilink").

### Thermals

[Optical Thermal Scanners](/wiki/Optical_Thermal_Scanners "wikilink"). Let you
see people through walls, though not the floor. Only used by
[Traitors](/wiki/Traitor "wikilink").

### Traitor

The **traitor**, sometimes referred to as the
[Syndicate](/wiki/Syndicate "wikilink"), is a role given to one of the human
players in [Traitor](/wiki/Game_Modes#Traitor "wikilink") rounds. A traitor is
a character designated as an antagonist against the station. The player
determines what the traitor's goals are and how they will go about
accomplishing them; these goals can be anything from theft to
assassination to terrorist activity, but are intended to create a
challenging situation for the non-traitor crew to deal with.

May also be used to refer to any other Syndicates (see
[Nuclear](/wiki/Game_Modes#Nuclear "wikilink") and similar) or Revolutionaries
(see Game [Revolution](/wiki/Game_Modes#Revolution "wikilink")).

See also: [Traitoring](/wiki/Traitoring "wikilink"),
[Traitor](/wiki/Game_Modes#Traitor "wikilink").

### Vore

[Short for Vorarephilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorarephilia) and
the main reason most of you are here. General is acted on by a predator
and prey. Common Vore terms listed below.

### Wormhole

A black swirly portal. Anything coming into contact with a wormhole will
be teleported to a random area on or off the station. They can be fairly
dangerous, or simply cause temporary trouble. Not to be confused with
portals made from the Handheld Teleporter, which are blue or (more
rarely) orange.

### You Hear a Voice in Your Head...

A subtle, in-character message from an admin. Generally, you should
follow the advice it gives.

### Wizard

Usually refers to the [Wizard](/wiki/Wizard "wikilink") game mode, or a Wizard
player who has access to a number of spells.

### Z-Level

Another "area" of the game. Part of BYOND's functionality. For example,
the station, the Telecomms satellite, the mining station, CentCom and
the derelict are all on different Z-levels. Going off the edge of one
Z-Level will take you to another. Right now most of these transitions
are random. Try to avoid being spaced.

### ZAS

Stands for **Z**one **A**tmospherics **S**ystem, Baystation12's
<s>dysfunctional</s> atmospherics simulator.
