Welcome to your lab!
--------------------

You think you know all there is to know about xenobiology – you just
finished your studies and graduated at the top of your class, of course
you're going to be amazing at this! Well, no! Stop thinking that, start
thinking about reading this page. Your lab consists of your equipment
and machinary.  

-   • The slime core growth apparatus is where you grow your slimes
    from.
-   • The Biological Sample Storage contains all of your slime cores at
    the start of the shift.
-   • The Slime extractor is used to extract slime cores from a fully
    grown slime.
-   • A chemistry dispenser for dispensing chemicals such as sugar,
    radium and for mixing other chemicals such as unstable mutagen.
-   • All-In-One Grinder for grinding reagent holders.
-   • Stun gun and stun baton for incapacitating slimes.
-   • A slime analyzer.

Now that you're familiar with your equipment, you should get some things
to mutate and feed your slimes with. Any kind of food will work and so
will woodpulp and sugar. For mutations, unstable mutagen and radium are
recommended. You feed your slimes by putting them into the injector
machines and injecting them with the food chemicals. You do the same to
mutate them - put a beaker of whatever concoction you've made up into
the injector machine and pull your slimefriend into it, then inject it
to induce mutations.

The genes are straight from the Polaris wiki:  

#### The Genes

-   Biochemistry: Biochemistry determines the chemicals inside of the
    product.
-   Bioluminescence: Bioluminescence determines whether or not the
    creature glows, and how strongly it will glow.
-   Color: Color determines the base color of the creature, and the
    color of any kind of glow.
-   Internal: The “internal” gene controls the creature's reaction to
    any reagents injected into it, provided that they are mutable
    enough.
-   Learning: The “learning” gene controls the creature's ability to
    learn new phrases.
-   Physical: The “physical” gene controls the creature's health, and
    damage ranges.
-   Resistance: The “resistance” gene controls the creature's resistance
    to heat deviations from standard temperatures, with different
    tolerances for hot and cold temperatures.
-   Special The “special” gene controls the hostility, and if they are
    mutable enough, the chromatic properties of the slime. It's either
    one or the other, so dash any hopes of laser-proof swarms of
    creatures.
-   Speech: The “speech” gene controls the creature's ability to speak,
    and how frequently it does so.
-   Speed The gene related to speed effects the creature's ability to
    move freely.

The new xenobiology is very similar to xenobotany. Shockingly so.  
Each gene is assigned a random number each shift and you have to find
out by messing around with the genes, obviously I won't tell you the
exact step for it because it is much more fun to find out on your own.  
As a hint, you have to grow the slimes, extract 'em and have at least
one grey slime to apply different genes to so you can find out.

#### The Actual Process (**EmoxNeko's Senpai Edition**)

Always wondering why one person can do this job while you can't? Who
knows? While this 'process' is not required, it usually tends to work
right now with all the bugs and what-not. Things to note before you
actually start this process!

-   Every injector has a sixty unit empty beaker loaded into them.
    Shoving another one in there will quickly overdose your slimes or
    just bug out completely.
-   All slime cores have different variables. It's suggested to store
    them neatly in several boxes or something rather than putting the
    storage as well as labeling them to prevent bugs.
-   Some slime cores, even one you may grab from the default five given
    to you can be used to replicate more than one slime. (This is
    actually a bug. Don't replicate more than one with the same core.
    The core will eventually disappear, allowing you to shove a new one
    in.)
-   At the moment, disposals will probably kill your slime. You have to
    go in the cage anyway to put them in the injector. Don't be lazy.
-   Organization. Seriously. This second note. Guys. Organize things.
    Like, I cannot stress this enough. You will fix so many issues by
    doing this. Do your damn jobs.

With that, let's get to it!

First off, you'll need the tools of destruction as stated above. The
Taser Gun is always good to have if a slime gets 'too hostile' (though
they usually never do.) and a slime analyzer is good for detecting this
as well as genetic changes within the slime. You'll also need that godly
multitool they provide you. It's very helpful. Stealing every source of
Robust Harvest is also good (but bound to get you slapped and arrested
more often and maybe even taken down a level.)

Now that we have our tools, we can move on! First, what you'll want to
do is go to each console with a multitool in your active hand and click
the console and 'store' the buffers. Then go to the injector and click
it and it'll link the two. After the link, click the multitool twice and
it'll give you the option to 'clear' the buffers. Hit yes, repeat for
other three consoles and injectors. Be sure to link the right ones
together or you'll get confused now!

Once that's done, the multitool is essentially worthless. Sell it off to
an engineer or something. Or keep it incase the power goes out and
somehow unlinks everything.

Next up is grabbing a core out from the storage! Just plop one out and
put it into your hand. You have five. Since they're the defaults, I
don't recommend breaking them down yet. (Which we'll get to.) For now,
put them in the growth replicator next to the storage and see what you
can make out of it! For now, stick to one. If the core is still in there
after you've made a slime, congratulations, it had more than one baby in
there. You should always keep two grey slime cores ready to go. Also
mass produce grey slime cores by getting non-mutated adult grey slimes.

After you've got your slime, you'll want to go to the console of the
cell you'll put it into and eject the beaker. Afterwards, manually drag
your slime into the cell and analyze them. Print the report, and put it
into a labeled folder for the mutated ones so that you know what changes
you're doing and how important they are! You can also get the camera and
universal recorder from the Outpost Break Room for better recording of
results! Everything on this sheet matters. **EVERYTHING.**

From there, you have quite some choices. Slimes that are from the
default cores tend to yearn for 54 - 80 units of Nutriment. This is
equal to 60 units of Diethylamine to 53.5 units of Robust Harvest. Give
or take. The correct range to base it off of would be 60 - 120 units of
nutriment, but you know. Look at the reactions references up above and
feed them accordingly.

"But how the hell do you know when a slime is nearly done being fed or
about to grow up?!" There's many methods for this. But we'll focus on
the main three.

-   Every baby default grey core slime starts at 10 HP. If you're unsure
    of what's happening, Inject 60 units of Diethylamine/Robust Harvest
    into them. If their health is still ten, clearly they aren't grown
    up. This means you can feed them more at the expense of breaking
    your slime. This method is also called 'Force Feeding' at least by
    me.

<!-- -->

-   Inject however much nutriment, pull slime out, analyze, and it'll
    tell you how much it's growing up and its metabolism. This'll allow
    you to switch between force feeding (forcefully feeding it nutriment
    so it grows up) and just waiting for it to grow up on its own.

<!-- -->

-   Genetically bombard it so it forcefully turns into an adult. I'm not
    explaining things with the genes. It'd indeed be way more fun if you
    figured out yerself! But if you really wanna know, I'm sure you'll
    find a way to contact me and bug me about it. If you even know who
    made this edit. Does it even say if I'm the one editing this or not?
    **What have I done.**

Now, let's say you did all this stuff right, and you still don't have an
adult slime! Then here's some pointers and tips since we have a few bugs
roaming about!

-   Always preform 'stability' tests. This means that if your slime
    isn't growing up after absurd amounts of nutriment, you should try
    injecting Unstable Mutagen into your slime. On the console, it'll
    say 'Instability' and a percentage. If injecting your slime with the
    Mutagens doesn't increase this number, your slime is bugged and
    worthless or if it's supposed to be in the game, simply not
    metabolizing anything and once again, worthless. How do I know this?
    After reading the code, I learned. Slimes can be mutated
    indefinitely. So I doubt this was supposed to be in the game. But
    you never know. Also. Mutagens don't identify until the computer has
    scanned once more. So hit inject two or three times. You should get
    exactly 4% from each unit of unstable mutagen. If you get anything
    less than this, your slime is slowly reaching its worthlessness.

<!-- -->

-   Don't bother the admins, this isn't an emergency. Stay calm, and
    just see what's going on. What were you feeding it? Did you feed it
    too much, too quickly? If so, refer to the previous note. If not,
    then well. Move on to trying to fix this situation again! If your
    'stability' test passes and it's getting mutagens into its system,
    it's clearly Analyze the slime. If it has a slow metabolism, it's
    probably just being a pansy and taking a while.. Leave it to be
    alone for a while. If it, however, says it's far away from growing
    up, it's worthless to you as for it is in a metabolism lock.

<!-- -->

-   Still not working after this and it's growing on the charts?! Well.
    After this, there only comes one more thing to check. Inject
    Unstable Mutagens into it until it mutates again and preform the
    previous two steps. If these fail you at any point, your slime is
    bugged/worthless. Oh well! I'll look into this more!

*Now, let's say you do have an adult slime! You didn't screw up! Hurray!
But what now, senpai?!* **The answer is simple. We look over our options
and take a course of action!**

-   We have an adult. We don't need to do anymore work, really. We can
    just go drag it to the core extractor, and hope that we get lots of
    cores. The core granting range is immense, ranging from 1 - 20 cores
    per slime chopped up. When you get the cores, properly organize
    them, label them, and yeah!

<!-- -->

-   So yeah. You don't like the color of that slime? Want it to be
    something better? Maybe want it to have some Chromatic Particles in
    there?! Mutate it until you get what you want. After that, you'll
    just have to do the first option anyhow.

Alright! Now you've got all these cores, what the hell do you do with
them? You. Shove. Them. In. The. Grinder. And. Hope. You. Don't EMP.
All. The. SYNTHS. But seriously. Put a core into the grinder and see
what one gives. Whatever it gives, every one of that slime core you just
got from your recent extraction will give this same amount. The main
things you want from a core is Phoron, Mutation Toxins, and rare
chemicals such as Carpotoxins! The more mutated a slime is, the more
likely it is to have weirder chemicals.

**(Alternatively, you can just scan the core to see what'll be in them
so you don't potentially fuck yourself over. Seriously. This is yer job
to know this. It even tells you the base variables/stats of the slime
the core came from! This is easy for knowing if all your hard work is
even worth something. Ya know?)**

Seriously though. Here's how you do it. First you determine how many
cores you should use and how many you should save for reproduction. To
do this, always take one and grind it up and see what it gives. If it's
not anything rare/useful/hard to make/special, don't bother with
grinding anymore up. Write/Universal Record what it gives for better
management. Now you have a hand labeler in the lab! This is where things
get tricky.

Use the hand labeler and label every new slime core. If you want to
group them up together, you should label all the cores you want to group
together the same name! Now when you shove them into the storage
machine, they'll be neat and separated! Now it won't bug up by you
taking over all the variables of your other pure slime cores! Yay!
Right? That's good... **RIGHT?** The point is.

**You should keep proper management of each and every core.** If you
don't feel safe with putting them in the storage like most people,
that's fine. Put them in a box, on the floor, somewhere else! Just you
know! Organize them somehow! And never forget to label them! **EVER. OR
YOU WILL MAKE THE ENTIRE LAB INOPERABLE FOR THE ENTIRE SHIFT.**

Now, from there, you should save at least one-third of the cores you get
from extractions. Why? These cores have many uses. Grinding them up.
Breaking down for genetic manipulation. Reproducing masses of that
mutated slime core. So forth! You'll figure most of it out on your own!

After you're done fiddling with the cores, just go and repeat the
process. Use one of the grey cores you stores away safely to start on a
non-mutated strain of slimes, and a mutated core to start on a mutated
strain of slimes. Now go. Be the best Xenobiologist you can, like no one
ever was.

*But wait, senpai! Before you go! What's happening with the monkey
cubes? Why do we even have them?!*

You can shove reagents into them. I know of a couple of reactions. Just
shove things in there and see. As for a surefire reaction? Shove one
unit of mutation toxins into it. **Have fun.**

"HRMMMMMMMMM! You said that it'd be more fun to figure out this
suffering process of genetically modifying slimes! Why can't you just
tell me?!"

Simple, person who may or may not be directly trying to complain at me
for not teaching them their job. Because I'm not the one who made this
wikia page. Someone else did. And know what they said? "I won't teach
you because it'd be more fun to learn!" I won't be a jerk and have him
saying that then me snooping in here and plastering such information on
here!

**That's rude.** (Besides, you have my Ckey, just BYOND Message me or
something. Seriously. Or ask me ICly. I'll teach you everything, young
Voreling if you really want to know. Meanwhile, I'll work on a full
detailed guide on how to do it to release to the public down below. I'll
soon have pictures for both guides.)

#### The Actual Process (**EmoxNeko's Mistress Genetics Edition**)

So you've got yerself some pretty slimes, right? Tired of just getting
overpowered tons of Cyanide? Maybe tired of just getting Soropfic yet no
one wants to let you use it for that 'Just right, nighty nighty, insert
it tight' non-con sleep intercourse scene?!

Well. That's where this guide comes in. This guide will explain:

-   Why the fuck you have so much 'worthless' slime jelly!

<!-- -->

-   Why the hell you can't figure out how to use that Destructive
    Analyzer whatchumacallit Biological Genetic Hiroshima Bombarder
    whatever the hell machines!

<!-- -->

-   Why that newly made slime knows about the ERP you did hours ago on
    the Xenobio Lab floor!

<!-- -->

-   Every possible thing you can get outta these slimes and how often
    you'll get them!

<!-- -->

-   How to make your slimes invincible and untouchable by all means!

<!-- -->

-   How to get so much cyanide, you can basically kill everyone.

With that, let's start it off! We'll get to learn about slime reactions
first! Yep!

Now you can know the secrets to why the fuck you get all that slime
jelly! AHAHAHAHA! No seriously. Let's get to it!

Basically, these reactions are the same as in Xenobio1, but can now be
controlled and grow in effect based on how 'big' they are! You know what
that meeeeans!

One slime core gives 5 slime jelly, and different mutated slimes give
different chemicals. For example, some can give Mutation Toxins, but it
mostly comes down to RNGesus, just like the old Xenobiology. Once you
get a good slime that creates Phoron and Mutation Toxin, you can
basically start to mass produce reactions like you used to be able to do
in old Xenobiology when you got a specific slime (Ex: Dark purple
slime.)

Let's show you the list of reactions, show we?! Reactions:

-   Slime Food Spawn: 10 phoron, 10 slime jelly, 10 nutriment

(Selects from all possible foods that you can have! You might get a
Wizard Burger for all I know! RNGesus be with you.)

-   Slime Minerals: 20 phoron, 40 slime jelly, 20 aluminum

(Spawns all possible mine-able minerals. Screw you miner, we'll mass
produce diamonds and such ourselves! For science!)

-   Slime Flashlight: 5 phoron 5 slimejelly 10 water

(Like using the Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead Cranial Flashlight but shoved
into a beaker and barely functions for long. Hence the low cost.)

-   Slime Phoron (10 phoron sheets): 20 phoron 20 uranium 20 slimejelly

(So you don't have to waste phoron to soldify phoron, but you can waste
phoron to solidfy phoron.)

-   Slime Freeze: 10 phoron 10 coolant 10 slimejelly

(So you can be a jerk and make the entire bar cold to douse out your
friends' sick roasting sessions.)

-   Slime Frost Oil: 5 water 5 coolant 5 slimjelly 5 phoron

(Not a fan of obviously freezing everyone? **Drug their drinks.**)

-   Slime Fire: 60 phoron 30 slimejelly 30 potassium

(Grief the server and I'll boop you myself. This is also a massive waste
of Phoron unless you're a
[TR-8R.](http://ss13polaris.com/wiki/doku.php?id=game:guides:traitor)
Dead serious. Don't abuse this. **Seriously. I will toss a damn spoon
through your damn organ cavities.**)

-   Slime Advanced Mutation Toxins (Turns the injected victim into
    Promethean): 15 phoron 15 slimejelly 15 mutationtoxins

<!-- -->

-   Slime heal (AOE heal effect. The Range for this is that it affects
    anyone who can see the beaker activating the reaction itself. This
    is included for people who hold them. Have fun, Medbay. ): 10 phoron
    10 bicaridine 10 kelotane 10 inaprovaline 10 slimejelly

<!-- -->

-   Slime Jelly: 20 phoron 50 sugar 50 lithium (Extremely high cost,
    will run the chem dispenser out quick, along with plasma. For the
    impatient Xenobiologist. Seriously not recommended. Like. Seriously.
    This is a stupid idea. **Just steal/mass produce Robust Harvest!**)

<!-- -->

-   Slime Vore Mobs: 20 phoron 20 nutriment 20 sugar 20 mutation toxins

(I mean. Yeah. Get eaten. Don't get eaten. Whatever. Eat it, don't eat
it. Whatever. Just. Please. Stop snek abuse.)

So yeah! I mean, yeah. Yay. Yeah! Now you may be wondering. "So we can
do all this cool stuff, but what the hell is the point of Xenobio2? It's
just Xenobio1 with less murder!!"

That's where yer wrong. We also have that Xenobotany feel to it now. We
can alter Slime Genetics now! That's right! The loveable creatures can
now be made into immortal, laser proof demonic spawns in which you've
given birth to! I know, I know. Yer thinking: "What kinda things can we
do with genetics?!" Well. Lemme list some things!

-   You can transfer memories from one slime to another. That way,
    you'll always have that slime mimicking you having sex with your
    lover.

<!-- -->

-   You can control the biochemistry of yer slime. Useful for
    temporarily switching out all that hidden Cyanide for useful stuff.
    They'll never know that it was you all along.

What kinds of things can ya get, ye ask? That's pretty simple! Here's

When you scan a core, there's always a 100% chance to get atleast 2
units of any of the above. After that, you have a 75% chance to get
another one of these options, with 1 to 5 units spawning in per core.
After that, you'll have a 50% chance to get another one of these options
with 1 - 5 units spawning in, and then another chance at another one,
25% chance, 1 - 5 units spawning in. You will always get 5 slime jelly
per core! Always. If one additional chance proc fails, you won't get the
chances after them.

    pet flashlight that isn't in yer brain or being forced out of a

-   YOU CAN CHANGE THE COLOR. AHHH. GLOWING RAINBOW SLIMES. WEW.

-   You can control their internal processing system! This can
    potentially be the greatest thing ever. Using this to homebrew
    non-lethal Mindbreaker Toxins that heal you for a long ass time is
    good.

    wow. Or you get to make the damned slime hostile and fail at life
    and make an army that'll also kill you.

    skills or if he even can! (As in. How much he talks about how much
    he processed things and if he even can at all.)

<!-- -->

-   You can control its speed. Need I say more? Gotta. *Go.* **FAST.**

See? Wasn't that fun?! Now. I listed off all this boring, *irrelevant*
stuff, but that doesn't answer **HOW** you do this stuff! Well, let me
explain, shall I?

First off, you'll need a core. Preferably mutated. And you'll need a
whole lotta patience and careful looking. First, what you have to do is
grab that core, and get down to the chem dispenser in the lab. Below
this dispenser there's something called the biological product
destructive analyzer! Now. All ya gotta do is shove the core in there
and then to the left, on the table, they'll be some data disks! Shove
one in there and you're ready to get to work! Here's the specific
step-by-step process from there!

-   After the core is in and the disk is in, you'll need to process the
    genome, which will **DESTROY** the core, but will give you nine
    genomes in which you can extract.

<!-- -->

-   After you have the list of extractable genes, you should extract two
    to three. The Gene Decay will increase each time you extract one,
    and when it reaches one-hundred percent, the core is unusable and
    you'll have to shove another one in there!

<!-- -->

-   One disk is used per gene extracted! So make them count. I don't
    think you can really get any more disks! But yeah. After you have a
    disk with a gene loaded onto it, step over to the Hiroshima Genetic
    Radiation Bombarder, which looks like a damned cellular cancer tube
    from DOOM 2.

<!-- -->

-   Shove the disk into the cancer tube or bombarder or whatever have
    you call it. From there, shove any type of slime, as long as it's
    non modified into the bombarder and not from the same type of core
    you used to extract the genes. Analyze it before shoving it into the
    bombarder and print the report.

<!-- -->

-   From there, modify it once, and check to see what's different from
    the previously analyzed settings. If nothing has chnaged, do it once
    more, and check then. Do this repeatedly until gene decay disallows
    further modification or something changes. Gene decay in this case
    is for slimes only. So feel free to use multiple slimes to check for
    differences.

<!-- -->

-   Finally, when something has changed, make note of the gene number
    and what changed, and you have yer job done there. You now know what
    that gene type does! Congrats!

<!-- -->

-   Now that yer done, repeat the steps for the other genes and discover
    what they all do so you know how to transfer memories and
    biochemistry!

See? Now ya know genetics! Hurray! From there, I can only teach you
about the almighty Prometheans themselves!

#### The Actual Process (**EmoxNeko's Loli Promethean Knowledge Edition**)

Now it's come to this. You have that slimy monkey cube and you wanna
know what comes from it? A damned Promethean does! What's so special
about Prometheans? Simple! This is the list of cool stuff for it!

Pros:

-   Stepping on shards and such won't affect us!
-   We can't slip!
-   Glomping in place of hugs!
-   Immune to being stunned unless with Xeno Taser Guns Or Slimebatons!
-   Have a reduced chance for flashbangs making us deafened as well as
    stunned by them!
-   We are completely immune to being electrocuted! This allows us to
    hack everything with no consequences!
-   We can store electrical charges and then electrocute people!
    **(Currently bugged. Don't even try it.)**
-   Any toxins damage we get, we naturally regenerate!
-   We regenerate every damage type about one hundred percent faster
    than the average human!
-   We regenerate our internal organs! (Even though we have none!)
-   We can't get internal bleeding!
-   We can regenerate limbs! Cut them off, we'll grow them back!
-   We don't need oxygen! All damage dealt by losing it is worthless!
    Air related viruses don't affect us!
-   We don't have any circulatory system! Blood related viruses and such
    kinda don't harm us!
-   We have no organs! We can only get sick by admins and bugs!
-   Unarmed attacks replaced with noms! (Might possibly inject active
    reagents into the target it hits.)
-   When moving, if you preform an unarmed nom attack within 2 IC
    seconds of moving, you'll get a 65% increased chance to knock down a
    target!
-   We can manipulate our body color, species type, hair type, and
    gender mid-round! We don't actually get the stats for said species
    type however.
-   Healing items have 25% increased effectiveness!
-   We don't have DNA! Genetic fuckery can't harm us! Nor can DNA
    Related Damage! (Much.)
-   Our metabolism has a higher chance of starting fast!
-   We are slightly more resistant (5%) to radiation giving us toxins
    damage and can't be mutated by radiation or most other means!
-   We're very pain resistant!
-   Lewd slime stuff!
-   20% Extra Health!
-   We're immune to phoron-related damage! Breathing it in also does
    nothing.
-   We take 50% of all brute damage rather than 100%!
-   We're the best janitors! We can clean things up with our bare feet!
-   When our limbs blow up, our gibs have a chance to hit anyone within
    one tile of us and send them staggering back with some decent
    damage! Neat defense mechanisms!
-   We're robust. Our limbs only take two seconds to regenerate (per
    limb)!
-   We're even more robust. Our limbs get stronger and stronger the more
    they regenerate albeit temporarily.
-   When we're irradiated. We glow. In the color of our slime. Bright
    Lights, Colored Lewds.

Exact Promethean Stats (As to my knowledge.) Health: 120 (Base being
100.) Damage Resistances: 50% Brute Damage Weaknesses: 200% Burn Special
Effects:

-   Gib upon death, near impossible to revive unless ya know what yer
    doing or the person with yer core knows what they're doing.
-   Exact regeneration of damage is .2 damage per tick for all damage
    types! (Above Damage Regen Cap)
-   Regeneration is .4 damage per tick for all damage types below the
    damage regen cap.
-   Other stuff I'll list later.

Cons:

-   Apparently, we still can't push people unless they're smaller than
    us or other of our kind!
-   We take increased burn damage! 200% rather than 100%!
-   We can't really wear underwear or socks or undershirts!
-   We don't have DNA! We can't be cloned by normal means nor can we be
    scanned!
-   We will probably gib and explode when we die! It's near impossible
    to revive us if we die if someone steals our core or our core loses
    its spark of life!
-   All chemicals that don't affect damage values (or all chemical
    portions that don't affect damage values) are seemingly more
    effective on us! This is a bad thing because we can drink small
    amounts of vodka and would be more drunk than drinking sixty units
    in two seconds! Sometimes, at least. Basically. Alcohol will screw
    you up at times.
-   You have a severely reduced disarming chance! (Unless disarming
    another Promethean.)
-   Most of the time, you can't strip people unless you have them
    reinforced with a grab compared to just being able to do it. I think
    this is regular though and not subjected to us.
-   Everyone wants to eat you because you taste good and would make
    their bodily fluids more sticky and potent.
-   We're made of slime. We cannot push people down. We can force them
    to the ground though.
-   When our limbs blow up, we have a three second period in which we
    are in an immensely weak state until our limbs proc the regen.
    Simply put, losing a limb puts you in sudden death for three
    seconds.

So yeah! I mean, look at that! --[EmoxNeko](/wiki/User%3AEmoxNeko "wikilink")
