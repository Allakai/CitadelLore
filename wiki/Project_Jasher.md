**Project Jasher** was a crowd-funded effort during the
[2250's](/wiki/Timeline "wikilink") to allow Demi-[Humans](Human "wikilink")
to escape prosecution of [SolGov](/wiki/SolGov "wikilink") by colonizing
distant worlds. Most notably, one of the four colony ships, the Chimera,
brought about the first human contact with the [United
Federation](/wiki/United_Federation "wikilink").
