The [Chief Engineer](/wiki/Chief_Engineer "wikilink") is the individual in
charge of the station's integrity and of the [AI](/wiki/AI "wikilink")'s
structural well-being. That means making sure there are no breaches,
equipment remains operational, and the AI doesn't get any weird laws. As
the chief engineer, you have authority over station's
[engineers](/wiki/Station_Engineer "wikilink") and the [atmospheric
technicians](/wiki/Atmospheric_Technician "wikilink").

Role
----

You are the head of the Engineering department, which includes not only
[Station Engineers](/wiki/Station_Engineer "wikilink"), but [Atmospheric
Technicians](/wiki/Atmospheric_Technician "wikilink") as well. Essentially,
your job is to boss Engineering and Atmospherics around and make sure
the engine, atmospherics, and the solars are [set
up](/wiki/Starting_the_Engine "wikilink") so that the power and air are
constantly flowing.

Other than directing the workflow of the department, you're also
expected to carry out general [engineer](/wiki/Station_Engineer "wikilink")
duties and maintain the [AI](/wiki/AI "wikilink"). To be a good chief it is
imperative that you have a good working knowledge of how APCs, SMES
cells, and power in general works, how to decipher atmospherics, how to
efficiently set up the supermatter and solars and how to get your
engineers moving.

Duties
------

It's no secret that engineers are more often than not the laziest of the
station's crew, and that there is no job that surpasses the capacity for
an atmospherics technician to be completely clueless about his own
department. This is where you come in! As stated above, your duties
consist pretty much entirely on telling the engineers and atmos techs to
work or just doing their jobs yourself. Listed below are those jobs.

### At the Start of the Round

Greet your team over the radio and establish your authority. Find out
who you will be working with and how many of them, and make sure that
everyone has a job to do. Designate someone to do solars (unless someone
else volunteers first) and get everyone else working on the supermatter.
If you take charge these first minutes of the round, most of Engineering
will follow the rest of your orders until the round ends. If you stay
silent then when you suddenly need something done halfway through the
round, you can guarantee that nobody will listen to you or know who you
are. If nothing else, speaking over the channel will at least tell you
who on your team you can rely on.

### Supermatter and the Setting Up Thereof

Setting up the engine and supplying power to the station should be the
first priority of the engineering department. Most of the time your team
will be fairly competent and you'll only need to supervise, but
sometimes you'll have to step in. [Read the
guide](/wiki/Supermatter_Engine "wikilink"), and make sure you know it. If
someone's clearly new, help them out a bit and show them the ropes. If
someone's clearly being an idiot then shout at them and forcibly demote
if they continue. With these points in mind the supermatter should
successfully start generating power. It's always a good idea to announce
this to the crew when it happens. It is also a good idea to have your
team set up the powers [substations](substations "wikilink") found on
board.

### Solar Panels

Whilst the supermatter outputs a ton of power, a hardened engineer like
yourself knows that it's volatile, and failures and problems can, and
will arise. This is where solars come in. Solars output a decent amount
of energy and can keep the station running at bare minimum or ration
power with substations whilst you inevitably sort out an issue with the
supermatter, but they need setting up first! Luckily this is even easier
than setting up supermatter and you can just designate one of your
engineers to go out and complete the task, better yet if they volunteer.

### Atmospherics, the Great City State of Pipes

The supermatter is radiating, the solars are wired and the engineering
team are at your beck and call. The station is getting a steady supply
of power and you're confident your team can maintain this and repair any
damage to the hull. Your job is done, right? NOT SO FAST, my friend!
Haven't you forgotten Atmosia?

Yes, as hard as it is to accept, that convoluted bundle of pipes and its
clueless staff are under your jurisdiction and it's your responsibility
to make sure that it's keeping everybody breathing. As the CE, you are
expected to know the basics of how atmos works, how to optimize it, and
then how to keep people from messing it up. If possible, it's
recommended that you have as much experience in Atmospherics as you do
in regular construction and engineering. Nobody likes a Chief Engineer
that does not know how to re-pressurize a room correctly. [Again, read
the guide and learn it](/wiki/Guide_to_Atmospherics "wikilink").

All you really have to do with atmos is get acquainted with its staff
(You can do this at round start along with your [direct
minions](/wiki/Station_Engineer "wikilink"), as they share the engineering
channel), make sure they know how to optimize it (if not, do it yourself
- better yet teach them), and then check back in if you feel necessary.

### Continued Maintenance

Now that the station's systems are running at maximum capacity or are in
the process of being made so, you can relax a little and <s>order some
pizza</s>. Here is what you should be doing:

-   Make sure the phoron tanks are switched out when they get low in the
    radiation collectors, or no power will be generated!
-   Periodically check out Atmospherics to make sure nobody's messed it
    up.
-   Listen to the radio for hull breaches. When you hear of one, send a
    couple of engineers out to mend the damage.
-   Supervise the supermatter and take action when it looks like it's
    going to explode.
-   Talk to your team. Make sure solars are wired or in the process of
    being done, and ensure there's always at least one engineer in
    Engineering to monitor power levels.

As Chief Engineer you may authorize [autolathes](/wiki/Autolathe "wikilink")
to be set up to assist engineering. You can also ask Security if they
will allow you to build a security camera computer to assist engineers
in monitoring damaged areas.

Links to Other Departments
--------------------------

You coordinate actions between the captain, the other heads of
departments, and your engineers. You'll be working with Security when
they need to get into a crime scene that happens to be depressurized
(this happens a lot), with Medical when they need to rescue someone in
an area that's minus atmosphere or plus poison (do try to keep them from
rushing in and adding to the casualties), and with Science when they
blow something up yet again. Your headset lets you keep track of your
engineers, where they are and what they're doing, as well as check in
with the other departments to be sure everyone has the engineering help
they need.

You have the ability to remove pesky [packaging](walls "wikilink") that
hold your potential meals, just remember not to permanently break
anything!
