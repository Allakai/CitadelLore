The Vilous Incident was a military conflict that resulted from the
discovery of the [Sergal](/wiki/Sergal "wikilink") species. It is known as
being the most disastrous first-contact scenario in
[humanity](humanity "wikilink")'s history to date.

History
-------

In [2524](/wiki/Timeline#2520s "wikilink"), the [USDF](USDF "wikilink")
commissioned the [Pathfinder](/wiki/USDF_Pathfinder "wikilink") among many
other vessels to discover unknown worlds and alien races beyond the
[Orion Spur](/wiki/Milky_Way#Orion_Spur "wikilink"). During the next four
years, the Pathfinder was intended to discover and chart numerous star
systems with frequent check-ins near the end of each year to archive any
discoveries as well as to make plans for the next expedition.

Under the command of [ONI](/wiki/Office_of_Naval_Intelligence "wikilink")
Director Hoshino Kayami, the Pathfinder crew's last voyage would take
them to the [Vilous](/wiki/Vilous "wikilink") star system in 2526, wherein the
expedition discovered a habitable arid world later known as
[Tal](/wiki/Tal "wikilink").

### First Contact

Upon arrival at Tal, the Pathfinder landed in a region called the Astna
Plains, wherein they were discovered by hunters of the Shigu Clan, a
group of Northern Sergals who worship a Sergal mythological figure known
as [General Rain](/wiki/General_Rain "wikilink"). Suffering from economic
hardship and widespread famine, the Sergals of the Shigu Clan attacked
the unarmed expedition personnel, killing or kidnapping all aboard the
Pathfinder. Director Kayami managed to activate a distress beacon before
she was captured and eaten. Sergals of the Shigu Clan then proceeded to
dismantle and vandalize the Pathfinder to salvage it for valuable parts
that could be sold to other clans who would have use for the technology.
Security surveillance recorded the incident. It is not known what became
of those who were taken alive, but they have never been seen again.

Because there were no survivors, the USDF would not learn about the
Sergal race until a second expedition could be organized. During that
time, the Shigu Clan inhabited the abandoned vessel as a hunting
outpost.

### Humanity learns of Vilous

When the Pathfinder did not report in at the end of the year, then Lower
Rear Admiral [Glenn Pink](/wiki/Glenn_Pink "wikilink") dispatched a
Prowler-class corvette from his squadron, the [USDF
Hoenir](/wiki/USDF_Hoenir "wikilink"), with a crew of 90 personnel to
investigate the last known flight path of the Pathfinder. In February of
2527, Hoenir discovered the Pathfinder's distress beacon, but found no
signs of life aboard the derelict vessel during a fly-over. This was due
to a malfunction with the on-board bioscanner, which incorrectly
returned a false negative to life signs aboard the vessel. Upon
discovery of the malfunction, the choice was made to instead land and
dispatch 30 armed soldiers who would board the Pathfinder and attempt to
locate surviving USDF personnel (or their remains).

Hoenir's ground team made contact with the Sergal clan approximately 30
minutes after landing by way of a Durasteel spear thrust into the chest
of the team's Lieutenant, which penetrated his light armor and killed
him instantly. The search and rescue team had been ambushed, and were
engaged in close quarters combat. 5 out of the original 30 personnel
were killed or eaten, but the rest were able to respond in force. The
survivors summoned the aid of the Hoenir, which hastily rescued them
before retreating into space.

### Sol Central's reaction

When word reached back to [Sol Central](/wiki/Sol_Central "wikilink"), Admiral
Pink immediately sought to dispatch a USDF battlecruiser and five escort
frigates to Vilous. However, it was election year, and then-president
[James Harvard](/wiki/James_Harvard "wikilink") had caught wind of Admiral
Pink's plans, and publicly decried his actions as "wasteful spending" of
[SolGov](/wiki/SolGov "wikilink")'s resources. In what was a very popular
decision at the time, Admiral Pink was ordered under threat of discharge
to stand down, and instead the operation's command was given to a rival
colleague, Admiral Antoine Fontaine. The operation was reduced from 5
frigates and a battlecruiser to only a single Phoenix-class [colony
ship](colony_ship "wikilink") called the USDF Column of Spring, and a
modest compliment of 2,000 marine infantry, plus an additional 7,000
civilian personnel.

No armed vehicles, military aircraft, special forces (such as ODST), or
other assets were deployed due to budget constraints set in place by
President James Harvard.

### Battle of Astna Plains

![An example of a fully equipped Sergal infantryman. Note however that
such outfits were not usually used in their totality during the conflict
due to their heavy
weight.](SergalArmor.png "fig:An example of a fully equipped Sergal infantryman. Note however that such outfits were not usually used in their totality during the conflict due to their heavy weight.")
In late 2527, the USDF Column of Spring arrived in orbit over Tal and
deployed three colony starter units, which were essentially a gigantic
drop ship with supplies and manufacturing facilities on board that could
be used to produce mining equipment, farming equipment, construction
materials, and most notably, military hardware if necessary. During what
would become known as one of the most costly military disasters in human
history, and the USDF's worst military blunder ever, all 2,000 marine
infantry landed with the three colony ships. Colony starter units Alpha
and Bravo accompanied 600 personnel each, while Colony Charlie took 800
marines and 100 civilian personnel to start construction of a forward
operating base.

During the initial landing, Sergal hunters had seen the vessels coming
down, and reported back to the Shigu clan's chieftain, General Snow, who
for the next fifteen days started gathering her forces for an all out
assault against the invading alien race. On July 4th, 2528, General Snow
of the Shigu clan initiated her assault against the USDF's positions
with a force of 500 Sergals, 50 of whom had been equipped with Durasteel
body armor salvaged and refined into Sergal body armor. Knowing their
enemy possessed firearms however, most Sergals (approximately 300) were
at least equipped with 6mm steel body armor over their vital areas, with
the remaining force having no armor at all, using their speed to be a
form of cavalry.

Despite 15 days passing since arrival, Alpha and Charlie bases had not
been fortified due to the absence of any serious threats. Despite being
armed with modern military firearms, marines stationed at the Alpha and
Bravo colonies were routed from their positions with heavy fatalities
during a surprise attack. Having already lost some 300-400 troops in the
first wave, survivors attempted to fall back to the Charlie outpost,
which had been the most fortified position due to the assistance of
extra personnel and civilian workers.

The Marines pressed Admiral Fontaine for an evacuation, but upon hearing
that the local alien life was armed only with spears, swords, and
primitive body armor, Fontaine denied this request and refused to send
evacuation ships. Consequently, the Charlie base soon came under attack,
and was forced into lockdown until it could organize a counter attack.

Once finally regrouped within Charlie base, and the lockdown lifted, the
marines retaliated with devastating effect. In the final skirmish when
the doors were opened again, only 32 marines were killed, compared to
over a thousand who were slain previously. Although it is not known how
many hostiles were killed at any given point in the battle, it is known
that out of 500 Sergals who assaulted the USDF positions, 472 bodies
were later recovered at various points across the battlefield, the bulk
of which were around Charlie base, with an additional 9 captured wounded
but alive for interrogation by experienced xeno linguists.

During the opening stages of the battle, roughly a thousand marines were
killed, most of whom were slain during the retreat to Charlie base.
Because of the general lack of ground vehicles, many marines were left
unarmed and outrun by the Sergals. Those who had to flee on foot were
only able to reach Charlie base by pure luck. During the counter attack
however, casualties were relatively light. The final USDF losses were
tallied at 1,057 dead, including the five killed months earlier in the
Hoenir's expedition.

### Admiral Pink's Redemption

When word reached back to Sol Central, Admiral Fontaine was soon
relieved of duty by President Harvard, possibly in a last ditch effort
to save his image which had been tarnished by the loss of so many USDF
lives. Admiral Pink was reassigned back to the campaign, and this time
made the decision to send only two escort frigates, as well as his own
flagship, a battlecruiser called the USDF JÃ¶rmungandr. Admiral Glenn
Pink later stated that he changed his original strategy, because the
purpose of such a heavy handed approach with five frigates and a
battlecruiser was to account for any eventuality that might result from
meeting an unknown alien race. Instead, the USDF Column of Spring had
already done that, though the results were at the great cost of human
life. Now that Admiral Pink knew what he was dealing with, he also took
with him 70 Orbital Drop Ship Troopers (ODST), as well as some close air
support assets just in case they were necessary.

As Admiral Glenn Pink was preparing for his mission, President Harvard
lost the Sol Central Presidential Election of 2528 to his opponent
[Rolland Requiem](/wiki/Rolland_Requiem "wikilink"). President Requiem gave
her approval for the mission in former President Harvard's absence.

### Operation Cheese Grater

USDF forces were evacuated off of the planet to regroup until Admiral
Glenn Pink arrived. However, upon Pink's arrival in May of 2528, the
first order of business was to commence orbital bombardment of the area
that formerly held colonies Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie. Some 5,000-10,000
Sergals who had begun to inhabit the area were killed by high energy
impacts from [Rail Cannons](/wiki/Rail_Cannon "wikilink") as a result. The
actions of Admiral Pink have been criticized by sentient rights
organizations as a "senseless genocide" of the Sergal people. However,
both SolGov courts and USDF public statements declared the use of
orbital bombardment to be legal and necessary in the protection of USDF
assets, including military hardware, which was destroyed by the
bombardment to prevent hostile forces from commandeering that hardware.
It is not known whether Admiral Pink knew of the Sergal colony that had
come to live at the former bases, or if he did not know until after the
conflict had ended.

Operation Cheese Grater soon began. Named after the derogatory name for
Sergals, which had been called 'Cheeseheads' by USDF Marines, Admiral
Glenn Pink launched all 70 of his Orbital Drop Shop Troopers to land in
the area surrounding what air reconnaissance had determined to be the
home city of General Snow. Under cover of darkness, ODST infiltrated the
castle-like fortress city, and assassinated General Snow in her sleep.
The next morning, ODST troops were to evacuate aboard drop ships, and
made their way toward the city center. During the evacuation, local
fighters put up some resistance, including a handful of Nevareans
operating domestic bolt-action firearms. Although some casualties were
sustained, no fatalities were taken among the ODST thanks to the
vigilant efforts of experienced medics. Having been both equipped and
trained for close quarters urban combat, the ODST were able to dominate
opposition forces on terrain where the speed and agility of Sergals was
rendered moot. It is not known how many hostile fighters were killed,
but aftermath reports range between one to six kills per trooper during
the evacuation; most of whom were city guards.

The body of General Snow was intentionally left behind "as a warning" by
Admiral Pink. No further Sergal hostilities by the Shigu clan were
recorded, although scattered resistance did continue in the north up
until 2552.

Aftermath
---------

Sergal militant forces scattered upon learning of their chieftain's
death. The USDF Column of Spring reestablished bases on the surface and
began a military occupation of the planet that continues to this day.
The USDF Pathfinder was also later repaired and recovered to continue
exploratory missions into the unknown regions.

This would later lead to [Operation
Dominion](/wiki/Operation_Dominion "wikilink"), wherein the USDF secure their
military holding of Vilous and begin construction of schools, hospitals,
and other infrastructure to promote a mutually beneficial relationship
between the human race and the inhabitants of Vilous. Lower Rear Admiral
Glenn Pink would be promoted after the incident, then again a few years
later during Operation Dominion.

A SolGov embassy was later established in 2552, and Vilous was formally
annexed into SolGov's territory as of 2558. As a result, naturalized
Sergals have been allowed to move freely within human space, and are now
often employed by human-owned companies, such as
[NanoTrasen](/wiki/NanoTrasen "wikilink"). Furthermore, because of the
presence of USDF on Tal, other alien races such as
[Nevareans](/wiki/Nevarean "wikilink") and the Southern Sergals were also soon
be discovered, though on far more peaceful terms. Nevareans would also
benefit from the annexation, though their home world of Eltus maintains
its sovereignty.

### Analysis

The events of the Vilous Incident are now studied in military colleges
as a means for a technologically inferior opponent to deal heavy
casualties to an invading military. Several key factors went very wrong
with the USDF's first contact, up until Admiral Pink intervened. These
have resulted in numerous policy changes for the USDF.

For starters, the initial exploration crew was unarmed. Though hired by
the military, weapons were considered unnecessary as the expeditions are
usually taken out to uninhabited worlds. Only a handful of times in the
history of humanity have there been sentient beings encountered, and
even with species that later became hostile (such as the
[Unathi](/wiki/Unathi "wikilink")), all *first contact* scenarios prior to the
Vilous Incident had been peaceful. The Sergals existed somewhere in the
middle. Though the Shigu clan appeared to be tribals, they were in fact
some remnants of an ancient civilization called the Shigu Kingdom, and
the majority of Vilous, so there was far more sense of nationality than
what is usual with tribals, and thus, far greater numbers working in
collaboration.

Second, the technological advancement of Tal's population was grossly
underestimated by Admiral Fontaine. By the time of USDF arrival, space
travel was not a foreign concept or some mythos of the gods to Sergal
culture. Sergals themselves were also far more intelligent than Fontaine
had given credit. For instance, the Durasteel body armor and weapons
used by a handful of Sergals during the assault were made from salvage
collected from the USDF Pathfinder. The armor could stop small caliber
weapons at point blank range, which most Marines were equipped with at
the time, and it could also stop direct hits from rifle caliber
munitions up to fifty meters, and due to sloping, the armor could often
still block glancing shots in up to five meters. As for technology, it
is a common misconception even today that Sergals at the time of the
incident were at a technologically equivalent level of humans in the
middle ages. This is simply not true, as
[Nevareans](/wiki/Nevarean "wikilink") by this point had already managed to
thoroughly accomplish chemical rocket powered space flight, while both
Nevareans and Sergals had already built cities in other parts of Tal
which had technology at least as capable as what humans had in the mid
20th century. Sergals understood what firearms were, but normally
preferred not to use them, as their natural speed and durability made
guns less useful in hunting. Why use a ranged weapon that can run out of
ammo when you can hunt with a spear that never does? However, the Shigu
clan still made deliberate use of stolen USDF firearms in subsequent
attacks. After the assault on Alpha base, the attacks on Bravo and
Charlie base were made with both melee weapons *and* stolen firearms.
Furthermore, General Snow was already an experienced strategist, and had
been carrying out frequent reconnaissance against the USDF's positions.
She had intentionally waited for the USDF to slip into a false sense of
security. The attack its self had been thoroughly rehearsed for a week
prior, including both a likely scenario in which firearms would be
stolen and used, and a less likely scenario wherein the enemy's firearms
would be too complicated for Sergals to understand. Considering that the
layout of most guns are fairly universal across alien species, it ended
up being the former tactic that was used, which resulted in even more
USDF casualties.

On the matter of Marine weapons, to quote Admiral Glenn Pink after the
incident, "Marines are to be used *as marines!*" During the first search
and rescue operation, the group of 30 marines from the Hoenir were all
armed, but were ambushed in dense foliage. The team was also heavily
outnumbered by their opponent, and in close quarters, they had little
time to react with firearms. However, despite the physical superiority
of Sergals in close combat, marines were able to inflict severe
casualties. It is estimated by eye witness accounts that for every USDF
soldier killed, at least five Sergals were neutralized before the
marines were routed.

Written in the USDF Xeno Survival handbook, page 67, it says the
following: "In the event that contact is established with any seemingly
intelligent species, every fireteam will carry at least one magazine of
armor-piercing ammunition per member. Exceptions may be determined on a
case-by-case basis in the event of extenuating circumstances by the
commanding officer. If local species are determined to be hostile, all
personnel are ordered to maintain a minimum distance of 100 yards from
hostile entities. Exceptions may be granted to individuals for research
purposes on a case-by-case basis by the commanding officer." Failure to
follow this protocol is the most major reason that the USDF suffered
such heavy losses. Upon the third landing at Tal, the USDF did not
encounter sergals for nearly two weeks after arrival, and positions
previously reconned by the USDF Hoenir were now empty and abandoned.
Believing that the enemy had scattered after being bloodied by the
Hoenir's expedition, commanders including Admiral Fontaine, instead
ordered their men to aid in colony construction efforts. Due to hot
weather and tight deadlines, many marines were not carrying their
service rifles at the time of the attack. Those who had firearms at all
had only sidearms, which were incapable of the stopping power needed to
effectively stop even unarmored Sergal infantry. There were also
reportedly communication issues between each of the colony starter unit
landing sites due to an ion storm at the time of the assault. A force of
500 Sergals was therefore able to overwhelm two unprepared USDF
positions, and nearly overtake a third.

Today, the need to carry weapons is more strictly enforced, and colony
landings are no longer conducted three at a time. Each colony must be
secure and fortified with automated turrets at the ready before the next
base can be built. Furthermore, vehicles are considered much more vital
wherein the terrain or weather does not prevent their use. In such
scenarios, [mechanized](/wiki/Mechs "wikilink") units such as the Durand and
Ripley are deployed instead.

### Backlash

The USDF was heavily criticized for the incident, especially over the
huge loss of life. Many questions were presented about why so many
things went as wrong as they did.

Most notable is why the USDF underestimated the technological
advancement of the races present so badly. The Nevareans had already
thoroughly achieved at least interplanetary space travel to the point
where they had begun commercial flights across their own star system.
However, these flights were not frequent, nor of any noticeable density.
Had first contact occurred on the planet [Eltus](/wiki/Eltus "wikilink")
instead of Tal, it is believed that first contact would have gone very
differently, because numerous communications satellites would have been
picked up by USDF sensors. Instead, because the landing was at Tal, the
few satellites that were in orbit were ignored as anomalies or natural
space debris. The USDF at the time still had the firm belief that they
were dealing with a primitive tribal race who would likely think of guns
as magic tools that could kill people without touching them. In reality,
the Sergals were already thoroughly familiar with firearms technology,
despite such weapons not being popular among Sergals themselves, and
space travel was not an unknown concept to them, it was just one that
wasn't necessary to the species.

The next major point is why a planetary survey was not conducted in
advance of the USDF Column of Spring launching its vessels. This is
because of a human error. The USDF Hoenir had already conducted a light
planetary survey in order to find the lost USDF Pathfinder, but its
objective was *not* to survey the entire planet. As such, the most major
city on Tal, the [Golden Ring City](/wiki/Tal#The_Golden_Ring "wikilink"), was
not seen or known by the Hoenir's crew. Upon return to SolGov controlled
space to report their findings, the data was misinterpreted as being a
complete survey of the planet, and due to the coming election year, the
schedule of colonization was rushed far more than it would normally be.
Under normal circumstances, two additional surveys would have been
conducted prior to any colony ship's arrival.

The most publicly criticized point of the disaster is the lack of ground
vehicles present, which could have saved lives among retreating USDF.
Although vehicles would have worked on the ground, the preferred method
of moving goods was via USDF supply ships which would travel between the
colonies and the mother ship. Military ground vehicles were not used due
to attempted cost cuts by President Harvard at the time. Thus, ground
vehicles were seen as largely redundant and wasteful.

Many other precautions were also skipped or circumvented during the
attempted colonization by the USDF due to budget constraints and
deadlines explicitly set by President Harvard, and the disaster largely
contributed to the failure of his bid for second term.
