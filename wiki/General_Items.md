### ![](Id_regular.png "fig:Id_regular.png") Identification Card

This things get you from A to B, as long as you have access to A, B and
everything in between. Every worker of Space Station 13 gains an
identification card. Your ID has your name, occupation, and a device
that broadcasts your access to the station's autonomous systems, which
is used both to identify the wielder and open up airlocks the worker
have access to. For example, the
[Quartermaster](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink") has access to the Cargo Bay
and Quartermaster's Office, while assistants, for example, do not. Keep
this in mind when you see a person in medical uniform with the [Head of
Security](/wiki/Head_of_Security "wikilink")'s ID card.

If you hold an ID in your hand and use an airlock with it, this ID is
used to determine if it opens instead of the ID in your ID slot. Also,
IDs will grant you access to [Computers](/wiki/Computers "wikilink"), but
remember to remove it from the computer once you have logged out.

A person with the rights to access an [Identification
Computer](/wiki/Computers "wikilink") can edit your ID to add or remove those
rights, it should only be modified by the [Captain](/wiki/Captain "wikilink")
or [Head of Personnel](/wiki/Head_of_Personnel "wikilink"). *Special
circumstances may change this.* When your face is covered your ID is the
only way of identifying you.

An ID is a tiny object and thus can be stored in a box. It can also be
stored in your [PDA](/wiki/PDA "wikilink"), and your PDA can even be stored in
your [uniform](/wiki/Clothing_and_Internals#Jumpsuits "wikilink")'s ID slot.

     This object is the only object in the game were the verb 'Read' comes into play (Verify).
    When it's been read it displays the following: 
    *"[NAMES]'s ID Card [TITLE]: The current assignment on the card is [TITLE]."

Storage
-------

### [file:GrayCrate.pngCrates](file:GrayCrate.png "wikilink")

Crates are a container for items. Especially large items, such as
[corpses](crew "wikilink"), [lockers](locker "wikilink"), and [certain
robots](roboticist#cyborgs "wikilink") or equipment cannot fit inside.
Just because an item comes packed in a crate when the
[Quartermaster](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink") receives it doesn't mean it
will go back inside once the crate is opened, either!

#### Give Onto the QM his Dues

Crates are worth 5 supply points to a
[Quartermaster](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink"), which can be used to get more
supplies for the station's whole benefit.

#### Of Locks and Access

Just like the rest of the station, even crates have variable levels of
access. The [Quartermaster](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink") can't unlock
anything that is locked by default, for various reasons. The primary one
being it would be pointless to make since all crates go through the
Quartermasters anyway. Security crates can be opened by security
personnel and those with higher access, and et cetera. An
[emag](/wiki/Syndicate_Items#Electromagnetic_Card "wikilink") can get into
locked crates, however.

### [file:Closet.pngClosets](file:Closet.png "wikilink")

Also knows as Wardrobes or Lockers, Closets are among the most common
and arguably the most useful of containers on the station. Nearly
anything can fit inside, barring other closets,
[crates](crates "wikilink"), and certain especially large objects like
[racks](racks "wikilink") and [Mulebots](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink").
Coffins in the [Chapel](/wiki/Chapel "wikilink") also count as lockers.

#### Of Locks and Access

Besides being [welded](welding_Tool "wikilink") shut, some closets can
be locked with the appropriate ID. Several levels of access exist, such
as security, captain, and private-level access. These can be opened with
the proper level [identification card](identification_card "wikilink"),
[emag](/wiki/Syndicate_Items#Electromagnetic_Card "wikilink") item, or a few
good laser blasts.

If you yourself are inside a locker you can see your surroundings.
Normally you can move in any direction to exit the locker, but if the
locker is locked or welded you will be unable to exit, and you cannot
unweld or unlock your cell from inside. At that point if you try to move
around you will instead throw yourself against the sides of the locker,
making a**BANG BANG** sound that can be heard
