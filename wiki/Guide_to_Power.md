Power is one of the biggest and most important concepts of engineering,
and the sooner you learn about it, the smoother your rounds as an
engineer will be regarding how power is distributed and contained.

Engines
=======

Interns that were somehow put in charge of what the VORE uses as a power
source can't seem to stop arguing, therefore the engine is changed every
shift, currently between the
[supermatter](/wiki/Supermatter_Engine "wikilink") and the
[tesla](/wiki/Tesla_Engine "wikilink"), though there's word of more engines
being utilized in the rotation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The supermatter is basically a highly unstable crystal made up of exotic
material, which is able to emit radiation and certain gasses once
energized. It can be energized by pretty much anything, but is mainly
powered by an emitter. This particular setup uses the SM to heat up gas
in the core to be extracted and piped into TEGs, which is utilized in
tandem with the cold gas from heat exchanging pipes in space to produce
power instead of using radiation collectors. A familiar but somewhat
unforgiving engine if allowed to delaminate.

<img src="Energy_ball.gif" title="fig:Energy_ball.gif" alt="Energy_ball.gif" width="64" /> [Tesla Engine](/wiki/Tesla_Engine "wikilink")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tesla is the engine that started the rotation. It's similar to how
the singularity engine functions in that there is a containment field
holding an unstable, moving, power generating anomaly, except that it is
a ball of energy instead of an angry swirling black hole, but the
particle accelerator is still present. Power is generated whenever the
ball of energy arcs electricity into a tesla coil, harnessing and
transferring the energy into the power net to charge the SMES. A rather
safe engine, the only thing that could go wrong would be if the
grounding rods weren't secured or if the containment field fails due to
a lack of power.

<img src="R-UST.gif" title="fig:R-UST.gif" alt="R-UST.gif" width="64" /> [R-UST](/wiki/R-UST_Fusion_Reactor "wikilink")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The R-UST fusion reactor is an experimental nuclear fusion engine that,
on it's own, utilizes fusion to generate power, though the proposed
setup will involve TEGs as well, much like the supermatter setup.
Usually deuterium and tritium are fused in a super heated field into
helium, releasing a large amount of energy once it occurs. Very safe,
will explode if the field is turned off, though, which would probably
release super heated kill gas everywhere and EMP a large amount of the
equipment surrounding the core.

<img src="Singularity.gif" title="fig:Singularity.gif" alt="Singularity.gif" width="64" /> [Singularity Engine](/wiki/Singularity_Engine "wikilink")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A seemingly popular engine, this setup generates a black hole and keeps
it contained by means of a containment field after being shot with
particles from a particle accelerator with the resulting radiation being
captured by radiation collector arrays. A lot can go wrong with this
setup if the singularity is fed carelessly, particularly when it's set
loose and begins consuming the station, which would probably warrant an
evacuation order.

Secondary/Backup Power Sources
------------------------------

### <img src="Solar_rotating.gif" title="fig:Solar_rotating.gif" alt="Solar_rotating.gif" width="64" /> Solar Farm

<small>*See also: [Solars](/wiki/Solars "wikilink")*</small>

Out west of Surface 1 is the large solar farm, which is always present.
The panels are already setup, all that's required is to scan for panels,
turn on auto tracking, connect the output wire to the SMES units, and
turn the SMES on. Most engineers will deconstruct two of the three SMES
units to consolidate the coils into one single SMES, which helps with
power management.

### <img src="Superpacman.png" title="fig:Superpacman.png" alt="Superpacman.png" width="64" /> P.A.C.M.A.N.

The PACMAN generators are normally used for emergencies when power goes
out and must be restored quickly, usually used for the engine room if a
crisis strikes there. Wrenching a generator on top a wire knot and
turning it on will supply power to that power net. Note that setting
their power level to max will generate a lot of heat, and remaining at
300 Celsius (800C for Mrs. PACMAN) will cause the generator to explode.
It should also be noted that PACMANs have stock parts and can be
upgraded by Research. There are three types of PACMAN generators:

-   **P.A.C.M.A.N.**: Utilizes phoron to generate power. Rated for 80
    kW, can output 100 kW max.
-   **Super P.A.C.M.A.N.**: Consumes uranium. Rated for 80 kW and can
    output a maximum of 100 kW, but the fuel lasts twice as long with
    the side effect of emitting low levels of radiation.
-   **Mrs. P.A.C.M.A.N.**: Uses tritium for fuel. Rated for 200 kW and
    can output a maximum of 250 kW, and the fuel lasts twice as long.

The Net
=======

The power net can pretty much be summed up as the nervous system of the
station, with wires running all throughout the entire facility,
connecting everything and powering important rooms. Below are headings
that give a rough idea as to how power flows.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<small><i>See also: [SMES Manual](/wiki/SMES_Manual "wikilink")</i></small>

A SMES (Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage) unit is basically one
large rechargeable battery, capable of storing several megawatts of
energy for later distribution, depending on the coils installed inside
the unit. These large storage devices are basically what (safely)
controls the flow of power throughout the station, determined by how
much energy it has and what the output level is set to. In order for a
SMES to receive power, a wire must be knotted under the terminal
connected to the unit and input must be turned on. In order for a SMES
to output the energy it has stored, a wire must be knotted under the
unit itself and output must be turned on.

### <img src="SMESCoil.png" title="fig:SMESCoil.png" alt="SMESCoil.png" width="64" /> Upgrading

The level at which a SMES can output energy and how much energy it can
store is based on the coils installed inside the unit. There's no
penalty for mixing different coils. To place coils inside a SMES,
unscrew the maintenance panel and simply place them inside, but the SMES
has to be completely discharged, otherwise the safety mechanism will
prevent you from placing any coils inside (and it's probably a good
thing, otherwise you'll explode from arc flash). To remove coils,
unscrew the maintenance panel, wirecut the terminal wires out, and
crowbar the internal mechanisms out, then just retrieve the coils that
you want and rebuild the SMES. A SMES can hold six coils, but all
pre-built SMES units around the station will have a couple coils inside
already. The following are the types of coils that can be installed:

-   **Basic Superconductive Magnetic Coil**: The most basic of the coils
    that can be installed in a SMES. Adds 20 kWh to capacity and 150 kW
    to transmission ability.
-   **Superconductive Magnetic Coil**: The standard coil that you'll be
    seeing in a lot of units. Adds 100 kWh to capacity and 250 kW to
    transmission ability.
-   **Superconductive Capacitance Coil**: A coil suited for storing
    large amounts of energy. Adds 1000 kWh to capacity and 50 kW to
    transmission ability.
-   **Superconductive Transmission Coil**: A coil suited for taking in
    and distributing larger amounts of energy. Adds 10 kWh to capacity
    and 1000 kW to transmission ability.

### <img src="Breaker.png" title="fig:Breaker.png" alt="Breaker.png" width="64" /> Substations and RCON

There are quite a number of SMES units around the station that are easy
to overlook, but the purpose of these units is to provide power to
particular areas of the station (medbay, security, etc.), which will
divide the grid into sub-grids, which carries a few nice reasons for
using these:

-   Grub damage/power draw localization
-   Control over specific department power usage

All pre-built SMES units (except for the AI Core SMES) have something
called RCON (Remote CONtrol) enabled, which allows for anyone with
access to a RCON console to adjust the input and output of a SMES unit
remotely, which is rather convenient given how many units are present on
the station, but the console is also used to control the breaker boxes
next to the substations which, when toggled (bypass disabled), will
separate the area from the main grid, relying on the area's SMES for
power.

<img src="CableCoils.png" title="fig:CableCoils.png" alt="CableCoils.png" width="64" /> Wire
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wire cables are what transfer power throughout the entire station,
usually from a SMES unit to an APC. The amount of power they can
transmit is restricted only to what the power source they're connected
to is generating, and the power currently in the cable can be measured
by using a multitool on it.

<img src="APC.gif" title="fig:APC.gif" alt="APC.gif" width="64" />APC
---------------------------------------------------------------------

An APC (Area Power Controller) is a console localized to any room that
supplies power to equipment, doors and peripherals, and lighting. All
APCs have an interface that allows you to control the three categories
mentioned, but they all remain locked unless you swipe an engineering ID
over it. APCs have terminals connected to them that are, in turn,
connected by wire to the power net. Based on the charge of the cell and
how much power the APC is receiving, as long as the categories are set
to auto, it will automatically turn off equipment to conserve power,
starting with turning off equipment, then lighting, then environment
once the cell eventually runs out of charge. Conveniently, the screen
color on an APC will change depending on it's status:

-   <span style='color:green'>**Green**</span>: Receiving power, cell at
    full charge.
-   <span style='color:blue'>**Blue**</span>: Receiving power, cell
    charging.
-   <span style='color:red'>**Red**</span>: Not receiving power,
    therefore not charging.

There are also lights on the side of the APC that show what equipment is
receiving power:

-   **Black**: APC breaker turned off.
-   <span style='color:blue'>**Blue**</span>: Category is set to auto
    and is turned on.
-   <span style='color:green'>**Green**</span>: Category is set to on.
-   <span style='color:red'>**Red**</span>: Category is set to off.
-   <span style='color:orange'>**Orange**</span>: Category is set to
    auto but is turned off.

### <img src="Powercell.png" title="fig:Powercell.png" alt="Powercell.png" width="64" /> Power Cell

Power cells are most commonly found inside APCs, but are certainly found
in other pieces of equipment as well. Without cells, the APC would
quickly cut power to all equipment it's in charge of the moment there's
a discrepancy in the grid. Below are the different types of power cells
as well as their charge capacity:

-   **Potato Battery**: 0.3k
-   **Heavy Duty Cell**: 5k
-   **Default Borg Cell**: 7.5k
-   **Charged Slime Core**: 10k, plus passive recharging.
-   **High Capacity Cell**: 15k
-   **Super Capacity Cell**: 20k
-   **Hyper Capacity Cell**: 30k
-   **Infinite Capacity Cell**: Infinite charge, duh.

SMES Settings
=============

Below is a list of RCON settings for the multiple SMES units around the
station. Ensure the substation bypasses are disabled when you turn the
input and output on for the substations.  
Note that these are only one configuration, and that others can be
perfectly acceptable. Feel free to experiment.

| SMES                  | Input | Output | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
