Before You Edit
---------------

We're glad you've shown interest in contributing to the wiki. Before you
can edit articles on the wiki, you will need to [register an
account](https://auth.vore-station.net/accounts.jsp?mode=create&redir=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.vore-station.net).
Registration is currently open to all users. This account will also be
used for our forums.

If you have any questions while you edit, you can leave a message on an
article's talk page or ask on our
[Forums](https://forum.vore-station.net/) or
[Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/0yCTdQTDRZL5CFSN).

Wikicode
--------

Wikicode is the strange syntax used by all sites running MediaWiki
including this one. If you don't know it and are prepared to learn, you
can do so [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wiki_markup) and
[here](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting). If you don't want
to spend your life learning this markup, then fret not, you can still
help.

How to Help
-----------

Before and while editing, be sure to consult the [Style
Guide](/wiki/Style_Guide "wikilink") for help on how to format new and
existing articles.

### New Pages

New content is constantly being added to Virgo, and most of it will need
to be documented in the form of tutorials, information articles, etc.
When new content is added, or when you see that a particular part of the
game is missing an article, you can [search for
it](/wiki/Special:Search "wikilink") to see if a page or section for it exists
and already, and, if it doesn't, you can create a new one. If you wish
to work on a page uninterrupted, make it in your personal
[sandbox](/wiki/Special:MyPage/Sandbox "wikilink") area or anywhere in your
own user namespace. If you don't know wikicode, you can create a
unformatted page and ask someone else to format it for you.

### Content Revisions

A list of pages which need revisions can be found
[here](/wiki/Category%3AOutdated "wikilink")

Updates are frequent and we need people to update the information on the
wiki. To do this simply edit the page to add any new information and
remove any old, outdated information. If you don't know wikicode you can
write the new, updated content on the discussion page without
formatting. If you're not sure about an edit, or if you're not sure if
information is correct, you can use the article's discussion page to
discuss any changes to the article.

### Images

If you have relevant images, then upload them and add them to the page
they're intended for. It is appreciated if the pictures of items you add
have a blank background and are in the .gif or .png format. The easiest
way to add images of items is to [download the source
code](https://github.com/VOREStation/VOREStation), open the icons .dmi
files and export images as .gif's or .png's from there.

### Canon verses Uncanon content

In the event that content is found to be contradictory to other content
found on the [Backstory](/wiki/Backstory "wikilink") page, it should be marked
as **uncanon** so that lore masters can correct the problem, or delete
the page if necessary. To mark a page as uncanon, add the following tag
at the top of the page:

`{{uncanon}}`

### Marking for Revision and Deletion

If a page is **out of date** or doesn't have a reason for existing, add
one of the following tags to the top of the page:

`{{Outdated}}`  
or  
`{{delete}}`

Character pages
---------------

You are not allowed to add a page for your own characters unless they
are directly mentioned somewhere on the wiki by some other page for some
necessary reason. The easiest way to do this is to be included on the
[Medals](/wiki/Medals "wikilink") page, as it means you have done something
noteworthy enough to be worth mentioning.

If you do write a character page, write it as if from the perspective of
an in-character biography written by a NanoTrasen employee. They would
not know anything about your character that is not already common
knowledge, nor would they include information that is not relevant to
the company.

Be sure to add the `{{Character}}` template to your page as well.

Jokes
-----

Some pages are intended to be entertaining. However, remember that a
newbie might not realize something is a joke or sarcasm, even if it is
blatantly obvious to the rest of us. Think about where jokes fit as well
as where they don't. For more information about jokes and humor in the
wiki, read our [style guide](/wiki/Style_Guide "wikilink").
