These pieces of advice aren't hard-and-fast [Rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink"),
but are good advice that people generally follow.

General Advice
--------------

-   Everyone fucks up sooner or later--admins included. Relax. No,
    seriously, relax. If you find that you are getting very angry over
    this game, we suggest you take a short walk and cool down. We're all
    human beings and the community is very forgiving of mistakes because
    God help us if we weren't. No one is going to hold a grudge over it
    forever (and if they do anyway, that's kind of sad and their time in
    the community will be short and painful anyway as everyone starts to
    hate them). Whether it's an OOC rule or an IC mistake that gets you
    into trouble, just try to learn from what went wrong and you'll be a
    better roleplayer for it! If whatever you did was so bad that you
    got yourself banned, just submit an appeal owing up to your mistake,
    or at least asking why if you seriously don't understand or agree
    with the ban.
-   Admins screw up too. We won't know unless you tell us. Again, we're
    human. I strongly encourage players to contact admins in private and
    confront those you think are doing wrong or could do better. We
    can't promise we can please everyone, but that doesn't mean we won't
    try! You'll never be banned for complaining to us in private.
    Contact Ace on the forums if you have any constructive criticism for
    admins--including himself. We want to hear your feedback!
-   If you join as an assistant, **get a real job sooner or later or
    we'll give you one.** You might not like the job we assign you. The
    game is more fun with a real job. If you complain about being bored
    and you're an assistant after being on station for several days, no
    one is going to take you seriously.
-   **If you find a clown costume**, clown around at your own risk, or
    you know what might happen. You have been warned.
-   **If you spawn as a mouse** (not a micro RPing as a mouse-anthro...
    an actual mouse), be warned that people are prone to kill you,
    ESPECIALLY if you're out in the open, making no effort to hide,
    and/or dicking around anywhere that food is served. Provided, if
    you're not playing as a mouse, don't be a dick to people who are
    actually roleplaying as one, and not just being annoying little
    pests.
-   **If you're playing any head of staff, try to avoid getting eaten so
    easily.** Or if you do, make sure your ID ends up somewhere safe.
    For instance, if you get eaten as the Chief Engineer, it helps to
    get the ID card to someone who knows how to eject the core.
-   **If you want to steal access to the station without pissing off
    admins, go eat someone with that access!** Give them a good long
    gurgling (unless they OOCly dislike digestion). Make sure you don't
    forget to remove their ID and headsets or you'll digest your prize!
    It should go without saying that the person has to be online who you
    go after, and you have to RP with them. Eating offline players or
    without RP is forbidden.
-   If you find your character involved in a heated argument, or even a
    fight, it's good to let your adversary know in local OOC that it's
    your character, and not you, the player, who is pissed off. I for
    one love a little drama once in a while to spice things up. Keeps
    the RP interesting. People come to this server for the vore but stay
    for the story (and more vore). My favorite scenes are always those
    most filled with conflict and tension. But sometimes people forget
    the difference between IC and OOC and need a little reminder that
    it's all just in good fun. This policy is very good to follow, as it
    has diffused or avoided countless moments of OOC anger between
    players.
-   If you're upset, calmly, and civilly, say something about it. Keep
    the conflict localized though. That means don't broadcast it in
    global OOC or on the chatroom or you'll be in violation of rules
    rather than just these policies. 19/20 times, you guys do an
    impressively good job at coming to an understanding. For the 1 other
    time, you can always contact an admin.
-   **Steer away from playing as hardened military veteran characters.**
    These characters are almost always done badly and we will probably
    mock you behind your back. If you're gonna be ex-military, you're
    better off being a grunt or no one important. Ask yourself, "Why
    would my character seek employment on a station like this?" If
    they're that much of a badass, they'd probably work for the
    Emergency Response Team or the Nanotrasen Navy instead. They don't
    belong in the crew. This also applies to politician characters or
    high ranking businessfolk. Unless they hit rock bottom, they'd
    probably get better pay and less work in Central Command.
-   In addition to above, remember that IC and OOC are separate. Just
    because you hate someone ICly doesn't mean you should hate them
    OOCly. Keep IC and OOC separate and you'll stay generally friendly
    with everyone.
-   **Although unwilling vore is be a crime,** falling under rape,
    manslaughter, or murder under space law, players should be lenient
    toward punishment in vore-related crimes. For example, if your
    sentence is, say, 30 minutes for eating a crew member, your sentence
    is 30 minutes... in character. If you don't want to get off your
    computer and take a 30 minute break while waiting for your sentence
    to expire, OOCly ask the security arresting you if they would permit
    a "Time skip." As in, pretend you served the full 30 minutes when in
    real-time you only served, like, 5 minutes.
-   '''Playing security? You're equipped with a mobile brig! '''Your
    stomach and anywhere else you can stuff criminal scum. Use it!
-   '''Try to limit use of the Global OOC channel. '''It gets spammy. If
    I am forced to mute it, I forget to unmute it and it disables local
    OOC too. Use Local OOC if you need to type OOC, or type (( in
    brackets )) through your PDA's messenger if you need to talk OOC
    over distance. Don't talk about off-topic nonsense in game. We have
    a Skype group for that.
-   Joined as the wrong job and no HoP is online? Going offline and not
    just AFK? **Use cryosleep to free up your job slot.** Use the map
    (button at top-right) to locate cryo. These are cryosleep pods.
    Climb in and disconnect (or ghost if you intend to respawn).
-   '''Power is out? No engineers online? '''Rather than hacking all the
    doors or disconnecting until someone else fixes it (which they
    probably won't unless they play engineers), just cryosleep and
    rejoin as an engineer to get the power up and running. Alternatively
    if you are unsure how to use the engine, send a fax and admins can
    receive it and send a broadcast asking for an engineer to join.
-   Don't like someone? Don't like something? **Don't take it into your
    own hands.** That always backfires. Talk to an admin. Directly. Not
    through a friend who's a friend of an admin. *Directly.* I cannot
    stress this enough. We're not hard to contact. You're not bothering
    us. It's our job.
-   If you find yourself arguing with an admin for more than a few
    minutes and it isn't going your way, give up. You won't win. If you
    still think it's unfair, seek another admin's council. Even if it's
    Ace, the top admin, if you explain your case to another admin who
    thinks he was in the wrong, he's more liable to listen because now
    you have someone else supporting your case. Although if you find
    that second opinion still isn't the one you agree with, you're
    probably actually in the wrong. Cut your losses and we'll all get
    over it.
-   **You'll never be punished for constructively criticizing the rules
    or admin policies.** Just keep in mind what that means. If you're
    calling one of the admins a faggot or some other blatant insult,
    we'll probably ban you and it doesn't help us fix anything anyway.
    But if you're just saying, "I don't like this admin because of how
    they handled this incident" then that is something we're more
    willing to listen to you.
-   **Above all, be forgiving.** Everyone, even admins, have their bad
    days. We fuck up sometimes. We're here to have fun! Let bygones be
    bygones. *Else we're just a bunch of horny furries and voraphiles
    crying over a badly coded Byond game.*

F.A.Q.
------

### Q: How do I vore people?

A: You should read the [Vore](/wiki/Vore "wikilink") page. Grab your target
(roleplaying it out, of course) with the "Grab Intent" in-game. Then
upgrade your grip to aggressive. Then click on whoever is eating! Be it
yourself, someone else, or if you click on the person you're grabbing
you'll crawl into their maw!

### Q: WHY IS THE SERVER LAGGING?

A: It isn't. I'm serious. It isn't. 99% of the time, any lag reported is
on your end and not the server's. We have a stupidly powerful bandwidth
and reliable connection. You can type '.ping' to measure the response
time between you and the server, and compare it to other players. If it
IS the server and you all have awful response times, then it's probably
going to go away shortly.

### Q: WHY AM I HITTING MYSELF IN THE FACE WITH A BAG OF CHEESE PUFFS?!

A: Set your intent to help. Also read the "new player" guide ya silly
clod.

### Q: Do I really need Discord?

A: If you want some way to contact the admins outside the game, it's
strongly advised. Otherwise we can't help you if we're not online.

### Q: Is there any voice chatting?

A: Not in the game, no, and discussing the current round with other
players while you are playing in the round is against the
[Rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink") because it is metacomms. You can chat about
other subjects in the Discord chat, though.

### Q: I found a guy passed out because they disconnected. What do I do?

A: If they aren't coming back, drag them to the cryo (or similar
system). This will eventually delete the character and free their job
slot. Give them at least 60 minutes if they disconnected without
warning. You don't have to stand there and wait for them, though.

### Q: Can I have the vore code?

A: Sure: <https://github.com/VOREStation/VOREStation>

### Q: Can I have a custom item?

A: Only if you can make the sprite for it! You can request them on
GitHub as an issue, or on the forums.

### Q: How do I reform? / Is there reforming allowed?

A: The short answer: Yes. Contact the medical department and they can
arrange ways for you to come back after dying. They are not magical,
magic does not exist in the setting.

The long answer: ICly, because "magic" in this world must be explainable
scientifically and magic reforming is thus not allowed, we instead have
resleeving. Resleeving will recreate your mind and stuff it back into
your body. You will have Clone Memory Disorder (see the
[Rules](/wiki/Rules "wikilink")) and not remember who killed you, unless they
are fine with that. CMD is typically to protect antagonist roles on
other servers, but here it is to protect non-consensual ERP sessions. If
the pred/dom in your ERP session that killed you has expressed via OOC
means that they do not mind you remembering, you may remember what
happened. Out of respect for those that DON'T remember, you should
probably roleplay it as slowly coming back to you, or have fuzzy or
incomplete memories.

If your character refuses to use the on-station revival facilities, you
may use the OOC verb 'Respawn' after some time has passed (20 minutes+)
and rejoin, though you should have a reason for doing this (you have a
contract with an off-site cloning facility, etc). You can take the "Life
Crystal" loadout item if you wish to have an in-character explanation
for this already provided to you. Read the guide included with it,
in-game.

### Q: Space law says murder is a capital crime! What if I get caught eating someone?

A: In-character, it's still illegal. But out of character, players
generally agree to be lenient toward vore related crimes. Furthermore,
you will never be permakilled by an admin's orders or permanently thrown
in jail for a vore crime. I just won't allow it. We'll use OOC loopholes
like pretending your 5 minute jail sentence was 2 hours like Space Law
says it should be.

### Q: How can I donate?

A: You can donate here through Paypal. Paypal account not required if
you have a credit/debit card.

### Q: Do the admins hate me? :(

A: Probably not.

### Q: I got underage banned, but I'm not underaged! I was born in blah blah blah...

A: Giving a date of birth doesn't mean a thing. To appeal an underaged
ban, you must include a photo of yourself, your username held up on a
piece of paper in the photo, words on that paper saying, "I was underage
banned from VORE Station", AND some form of photo ID in the photo. We're
not asking for anything official. A school ID is fine. Worried about us
stealing your info? Blot out your address, your license number, anything
sensitive. We just want an ID with your photo on it that we know only
someone of age could possess.
