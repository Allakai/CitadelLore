The NSS Exodus is a [NanoTrasen](/wiki/NanoTrasen "wikilink") science station
orbiting around [Nyx](/wiki/Nyx "wikilink"), a border system. The station was
initially completed in the year 2555 CE, two years after the infamous
vessel [NSV Luna](/wiki/NSV_Luna "wikilink") was decommissioned from service,
and has been renovated several times since then. The station is crewed
by approximately 50 to 60 employees who transfer periodically to and
from the [NAS Crescent](/wiki/NAS_Crescent "wikilink") (colloquially known as
CentCom or Central Command), NanoTrasen's operational hub in the Nyx
system.
