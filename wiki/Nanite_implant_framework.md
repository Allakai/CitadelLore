The Nanite Implant Framework ("NIF") is a sophisticated implant designed
to provide features over the span of several shifts. It's a persistent
inter-round item that once implanted, can be used indefinitely, provided
the character takes care to not lose it. The NIF is an implant that
constructs other implants or body modifications by using nanotechnology
'blueprints' called NIFSoft. The design was originally by [Kitsuhana
Heavy Industries](/wiki/Kitsuhana_Heavy_Industries "wikilink"), however they
no longer manufacture them. Instead, [NanoTrasen](/wiki/NanoTrasen "wikilink")
has designed a clone that is becoming fairly common in the
[Virgo-Erigone](/wiki/Virgo-Erigone "wikilink") system, while there are still
some original Kitsuhana NIFs floating around.

Obtaining a NIF
---------------

[Science](/wiki/Guide_to_Research_and_Development "wikilink") can create a
standard NIF, though they are fairly expensive to create in terms of
materials and research level. If [mining](/wiki/Shaft_Miner "wikilink") has
done their job, you may be able to make one or more on a shift. These
can be implanted (see below).

It may also be possible to locate second-hand 'used' NIFs that have been
discarded, In places such as [trash piles](trash_piles "wikilink").
Assuming they are old models that don't have a permanent pairing already
activated, you may be able to implant these, though it's not necessarily
recommended.

There are prototype 'bioadaptive' NIFs that may allow them to be used in
species without a brain ([Promethean](/wiki/Promethean "wikilink")) or more
complex species ([Xenochimera](/wiki/Xenochimera "wikilink")) though these are
not publicly available. Centcom should be contacted to arrange for
exchanging resources and a standard NIF for one of these. They do suffer
from their own problems, however.

Lastly, Kitsuhana Heavy Industries manufactured 'authentic' name-brand
NIFs that have higher durability, but these are also not available
without the individual to receive the NIF having an existing relation
with KHI, and resources/Thalers to trade for it.

Installing a NIF
----------------

A NIF can be installed via surgery. For organic patients, this is the
[cavity surgery](/wiki/Surgery#Cavity_Surgery "wikilink") performed on the
head, inserting the NIF in question as the object. For
[synths](synthmorph "wikilink") this is very similar, opening the head
and using a drill to free up additional space and implanting the NIF.
Installing a bioadaptive NIF in a Promethean is more simple: Simply
shove it directly into their chest. They are amorphous blobs, after all.

The NIF cannot complete a lengthy calibration procedure until the
patient is conscious again, at which point it will blind them for
several minutes as it attaches to their optic nerve/interface. After
they have vision again, they will experience mild to severe pain for
around half an hour, along with random blackouts. They should not
operate heavy machinery during this time, and may wish to request a
brief leave from their job.

Using a NIF
-----------

Once installed and calibrated, the NIF is permanently bound to the user.
They will have an overlay projected directly into their visual cortex
allowing them to see things that aren't there ("artificial reality").
They can enable display of job icons and 'health bars', among other
things. After calibration and several hours later, the NIF will finish
constructing a 'commlink', which is equivalent to an integrated
communicator.

These pieces of software are called NIFSoft. Additional software can be
purchased at vending machines ("NIFSoft Shops"). There is a wide variety
available, though some is locked to specific access and jobs. There are
also rumors of illegal NIFSoft, though these shouldn't be installed and
should be reported to security immediately.

When installing a NIFSoft, one should remember that a physical device is
being constructed inside the user's body, and this will wear the NIF
itself to construct. Some more significant modifications may wear the
NIF more than others.

Maintaining the NIF
-------------------

After many NIFSofts have been installed over time, the NIF may require
repairs. This is a simple task that a scientist/roboticist can perform,
however the NIF must be removed first. After removing it using the
[implant removal](/wiki/Surgery#Implant_Removal "wikilink") surgery, follow
these steps to repair it:

-   Open the casing after removing the screws
-   Replace any burned-out wiring
-   Use a multitool to reset each circuit
-   Re-secure the mainboard screws and reattach the cover

When re-implanted, the NIF will only take about 60 seconds to calibrate
to the user again, as opposed to the more painful original surgery.

Preserving your NIF
-------------------

The NIF is preserved in resleeving scans, so one can keep their NIF upon
death as long as they had a backup implant that successfully recorded
the NIF's physical state at least once. It will only be able to
reproduce the exact same NIF however, meaning the same durability and
already bound to the user.

Surviving the shift is also another way to preserve your NIF for the
next one, obviously, and short-range teleporters and cryostorage both
preserve the NIF for the next shift.

If one dies without any backup implants and has no body to recover to
obtain their original NIF, unfortunately their NIF will be permanently
lost and they will need to obtain a new one.

Keep in mind that if the shift ends, and you do not have a NIF, you will
not have it in the next round. If you are having your NIF removed for
repairs, make sure someone is available to repair and reinstall it!

NIFSofts And You <file:Nifsoft.png>
-----------------------------------

"NIFSoft" is the newest advancement in NT tech, allowing for quick and
easy software updates to your NIF system. Most NIFSoft is fairly
self-explanatory and the short description on the NIFSoft Shop vending
machine (
<img src="Nifsoft_Shop.png" title="fig:Nifsoft_Shop.png" alt="Nifsoft_Shop.png" width="32" height="32" />
) can explain their use. Please be advised that you must have a NIF
installed to use the store, the stores only offer digital downloads not
physical discs. If you wish for a physical copy, speak with your
stations science department. However there are a few pieces of software
that warrant additional explanation.

### Medichines

Medichines are healing/repair nanites that consume large quantities of
energy while in use, but can save a life for organics, or save annoyance
for synthetics. There are two distinct versions of medichines: one for
synthetic life, and one for organic life.

-   Organic - The organic medichines will begin healing the user when
    they become significantly injured. If they become critically
    injured, they will operate at an enhanced rate, but while consuming
    a significant amount of energy. If the user is subjected to more
    injury than they are able to heal, the user will be put into
    emergency stasis, and the medical department will be notified via
    radio of the user's location.
-   Synthetic - The synthetic medichines are capable of synthetic
    self-repair, but only to a small extent. Any damage that would show
    as less than a '5' on a scanner can be automatically repaired by
    synthetic medichines, allowing the user to avoid buffing out scrapes
    and dents, saving them time from common workplace accidents that
    cause them.

### Soulcatcher

**NB:** This does not mean 'metaphysical magical energy', it's just the
name.

This NIFSoft is designed to preserve minds in case of emergency, and
would be a useful feature for a combat medic. The NIFSoft makes a live
mind-backup of the user should they die, and hosts them in a VR
environment until they are rescued. Additionally, it can do the same to
others, should they die while being held by or inside the soulcatcher
user. This will load their mind into the same VR environment, and they
will be able to communicate directly with the owner until such a time
they are revived elsewhere.

The SleeveMate 3200 handheld brain scanner can also place stored minds
into soulcatcher owners, allowing one to load critically injured
patients into the soulcatcher to prevent unnecessary pain, or to allow
patients who are unable to undergo surgery or anesthetic treatment to be
stored while surgery is performed. Simply use the SleeveMate 3200 to
store the 'whole mind', and then aim it at a person with a NIF and the
Soulcatcher NIFSoft. An additional option will appear to load the mind
into them.

The soulcatcher can also perform backups of the minds installed inside,
just like a backup implant. This will prevent the notification to
medical that the user has died needlessly, as the soulcatcher user is
likely working on the issue already, or they are just storing them for
recreational purposes and there's no need to resleeve them yet.

Others may come up with additional 'creative' uses of the soulcatcher.

**Ghosts may also join into a Soulcatcher by picking the "Ghost &gt;
Join Into Soulcatcher" verb**, similar to how ghosts may make
communicator calls. It is not possible to resleeve ghosts into physical
bodies from this method, there's no way to ghost into a soulcatcher then
gain a new body. Ghost out of the Soulcatcher to leave, and join the
round normally.
