The NSS Exodus is a [[NanoTrasen]] science station orbiting around [[Nyx]], a border system. The station was initially completed in the year 2555 CE, two years after the infamous vessel [[NSV Luna]] was decommissioned from service, and has been renovated several times since then. The station is crewed by approximately 50 to 60 employees who transfer periodically to and from the [[NAS Crescent]] (colloquially known as CentCom or Central Command), NanoTrasen's operational hub in the Nyx system.
