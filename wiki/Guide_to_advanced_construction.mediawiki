The page details the construction of "machines", a class of fairly complex objects used aboard the station. The basic process of construction is the same for all machines; only the parts used change.

*Activate a stack of at least 5 metal sheets in-hand.
*Select 'Frame' from the list that appears
*After a short crafting time, frame parts will be on the floor where your character is standing. [[File:Frame parts.png]]
*Pick those up and activate them to select the type of machine you are making. (Most things just use the generic Machine frame or computer) [[File:Empty Machine Frame.png]]
*After making a frame, right click it to rotate the facing if it's a directional machine like body scanners or consoles.
*Use a [[wrench]] on it to secure the frame to the floor.
*Insert the [[circuit board]] for the machine you are making into the frame. (Get these from R&D.) [[File:Circuit Frame.png]]
*Apply a screwdriver to secure the circuit board. [[File:Machine Frame.png]]
*Insert wires into the frame.[[File:Wired Frame.png]]
*You can now examine the frame to see what extra parts the machine needs. (Also get these parts from R&D. You can use upgraded parts for some machines!)
*After inserting all required parts (examining will give a message along the lines of 'Requires nothing'), use a screwdriver on it again.


Some machines can be [[Research_Director#Upgrading_the_station|upgraded by science]] to make them more efficient.
