The Tesla Engine is an alternative power source to the supermatter
engine, located in Engineering.

How it Works
------------

### Tesla Generator

The Tesla generator works just like the singularity generator does,
except that it makes an energy ball instead of a swirling black hole of
death.

#### Energy Balls

This big floaty ball of pure electricity can only be contained by the
containment field. When you shoot the energy ball with the Particle
Accelerator, it gains energy like a singularity, but when it hits 300
energy, it generates a mini-energy ball that orbits the big energy ball.
This will send off an extra shock when the energy ball pulses which can
happen as many times as you let it. The energy ball will also naturally
generate small amounts of energy, so eventually a second ball will form.

**Be warned**, the more mini-balls the energy ball has, the more shocks
it sends out at once, and the further it can travel each move. A good
engineer can use this to generate lots of power, and a bad one can abuse
this to murder the entire station.

An energy ball will shoot bolts of electricity off at the nearest
conductor, which it prioritizes in this order:

1.  Tesla coils
2.  Grounding Rods
3.  Mobs
4.  Machines

##### Tesla Coils

![](Tesla_Coil.gif "fig:Tesla_Coil.gif")Tesla coils will attract the
bolts. They will take half the power of the bolt (if they are connected
to a powernet), pump it into the powernet it is hooked to, and then will
send the other half of the power to the next available conductor, which
follows the criteria listed above. Preferably, this will be another coil
to harness more of the power and pump it into the grid.

##### Grounding Rods

![](Grounding_Rod.gif "fig:Grounding_Rod.gif")Grounding rods are safety
precautions to prevent the tesla bolts from hitting machinery or
personnel. If the tesla is loose, being near one will usually keep you
safe from direct shocks. It does NOT, however, protect you from the
explosions caused by nearby machinery or the inevitable
depressurization. Grounding rods must be secured to the ground to
provide any protection.

##### Mobs

![](Catgirl.png "fig:Catgirl.png") Being struck by a lightning bolt will
severely electrocute the target, often lethally. Huddling around an
anchored grounding rod will provide protection from the tesla's direct
wrath.

##### Machines

**![](EngiVend.png "fig:EngiVend.png")** Machines struck will violently
explode with enough strength to breach the hull. This is the primary
source of damage to the station from a loose tesla.

Setting It Up
-------------

### Equipment

The tesla is probably easier than the singularity because you don't have
to fill up phoron tanks and you don't have to worry about a subverted AI
setting the PA to max. This guide will assume that you're doing it
alone, whether because you're the only engineer that signed up, or
because everyone else buggered off like they always do. <s>Or they don't
want to set it up and blame the wiki never being updated with new
content, even though there's a guide literally right here.</s>

The engine is, for the most part, housed inside the station in the
north-west portion of Asteroid 1. You'll need some tools to set it up,
all of which you can conveniently acquire right in engineering. You will
need:

-   ![](Wrench.png "fig:Wrench.png") Wrench
-   ![](CableCoils.png "fig:CableCoils.png") Some wires
-   ![](Screwdriver_tool.png "fig:Screwdriver_tool.png") Screwdriver
-   ![](Oxygen_tank.png "fig:Oxygen_tank.png") Set of internals
-   ![](Engineer_Hardsuit.png "fig:Engineer_Hardsuit.png")Â A
    vacuum-capable suit
-   ![](Yellowgloves.png "fig:Yellowgloves.png") Insulated gloves

Now that you have your supplies, it's time to get to work! Note that the
steps below can be done in any order as you like, **as long as you turn
the particle accelerator on last.**

### Outside Engineering (Spaceproof Equipment Required)

#### 1. Wrench Down Coils and Rods

![](Tesla_Coil.gif "fig:Tesla_Coil.gif")![](Grounding_Rod.gif "fig:Grounding_Rod.gif")

The tesla coils actually capture the power from the tesla, while the
grounding rods makes sure you don't get fried by the tesla. Both are
very important because you actually want to generate power.

#### 2. Start the Emitters

![](Emitter_On.gif "Emitter_On.gif")

Now that you've gotten everything ready, it's time to start the engine!
Run around the containment area and turn on the emitters by clicking on
them. Once they're all on, carefully make your way to the inner circle
of the area, making sure not to cross in front of any of the emitters,
otherwise you'll get hit by a laser and get burned extremely severely.

##### 3.5. Lock the Emitters <span style="color:blue">(Optional)</span>

It is possible to lock each of the emitters by swiping your ID on them,
after activating them. This will stop an AI, or anyone without
power-management access from deactivating the emitters manually.

#### 3. Start the Field Generators

![](Field_Generator.png "fig:Field_Generator.png") Once you've ensured
that the emitters are on, it's time to fire up the field generators.

Make sure to stay on the outside of the field generators and activate
them as you move in a circle through the area. Coming into contact with
any of the field generator beams will pop your head like a midget in a
microwave and hurl your corpse through the engineering windows at
terminal velocity. It's a good idea to start on one of the inner
corners, and do the field generators closest to the windows first so you
don't have to worry about accidentally straying too close while the
corner field generators are on. The generators have a field of effect
one tile on either side of the beams, so make sure you leave a clear
zone around any active field generators and don't linger too long when
you turn them on.

### Inside Engineering

#### 4. Set up the Particle Accelerator

![](NewPA.png "NewPA.png")

Now it's time to set up the particle accelerator itself. First, wrench
each piece in place. Second, wire all the pieces with a cable coil.
Finally, use a screwdriver to close all the panels. Click on the console
and hit "Scan for parts" to link the console with the actual PA. This is
your particle accelerator set up!

If any of the parts were bumped or pushed around, you may need to put
them back into place. All the components must be in the correct
locations and facing the same direction. If a part was secured in the
wrong place, they can be deconstructed by using a screwdriver to open
the panel, wirecutters to remove wiring, and a wrench to unsecure it.

##### 4.5 Hack the Particle Accelerator <span style="color:blue">(Optional)</span>

[Hack the PA, and cut the limit
wire.](/wiki/Hacking#Particle_Accelerator "wikilink") This allows you to set
the PA to a power of 3, allowing the tesla orb to be charged to extreme
power levels even faster. The best part is that there's absolutely zero
penalties for doing so, assuming it never, ever escapes.

#### 5. Fire it up!

![](Energy_ball.gif "Energy_ball.gif")

Once the field generator beams form a box around the tesla generator
(the rod thing in the middle) get back inside the station and head to
the Particle Accelerator again.

The particle accelerator is used to feed the tesla and make it grow,
which results in more energy balls spinning around, which results in
more energy.

Move over to the particle accelerator control box and set the output to
2 (or 3 if you hacked it). You can leave the particle accelerator at its
max settings permanently without any ill effect. The tesla also doesn't
generate any radiation, so you don't have to close the radiation
shutters or worry about radiation collectors.

#### 6. Activate the SMES Cells

Make sure the engine grid SMES is set to charge and output enough to
keep the emitters and PA going (which is maximum input AND output.
Seriously, do this.), and the distribution SMES enough for the station.

After setting the SMES units up, check that they're charging. If it says
charging and the total stored power is increasing, the station will now
receive plenty of power! If you're still the only engineer, you may want
to consider setting up the solars to ensure a source of backup power if
the engine becomes unusable.

#### 7. Maintenance

The tesla is very low maintenance. All you really have to do is to check
that the emitters are still powering the shield generators. **Ensuring
that the engine power grid remains powered is vital. If power to the
engine network is lost, the emitters will stop firing and the tesla orb
will rapidly escape.**

Pros and Cons with Regards to the Singularity
---------------------------------------------

### Pros

-   Doesn't generate radiation.
-   Doesn't generate gravity, which means you can't be pinned against
    the shield.
-   The grounding rods mean that you *probably* won't get shocked.
-   When released, won't eat the entire station.
-   The total energy generated by the tesla naturally increases without
    intervention over time.

### Cons

-   Generates much less energy than the singularity.
-   A singularity, if released, has a 50/50 chance of heading towards
    the station or heading towards deep space. For a tesla, on the other
    hand, its more of a 80/20 chance because it is attracted to
    conductible materials.
-   The tesla can kill from extreme distances.

TESLOOSE
--------

If the energy ball is to get out of containment somehow, it will pass
through walls, windows, anything. It will shoot electricity at
conductors, mobs, etc, and direct bolts from the energy ball will
instantly kill just about anyone. Being hit by the ball itself will turn
you into a pile of dust regardless of protection. Any piece of
electronics, such as consoles, machines, or airlocks, will violently
explode when hit, causing vast damage to the station.

The energy ball usually moves towards the last direction it shocked,
which means that it will actively seek areas with more machines and
conductive materials.
