Primarily, the **Roboticist**'s job is to make [cyborg
bodies](/wiki/Cyborg "wikilink"), and generally maintain activated cyborgs.
Secondarily, Roboticists created helpful robots like Medibots and
Floorbots. A skilled set of Roboticists can even build a powerful set of
mechanized exosuits.

Robotics
--------

The Assembly Line is your home as a Roboticist. It contains exosuit
fabricators for the creation of any robotic component you require, four
cyborg recharge stations, four mech suit recharge stations, multiple
sheets of [metal](metal "wikilink"), twenty sheets of steel, [power
cells](power_cells "wikilink"), and a [coil of
wire](coil_of_wire "wikilink"), and scattered tables with a
[multitool](multitool "wikilink"), tool boxes, a few
[Flashes](/wiki/Flashes "wikilink"), a [crowbar](crowbar "wikilink"), a
[proximity sensor](proximity_sensor "wikilink"), more scattered power
cells, and a [cell charger](cell_charger "wikilink").

Before We Get Started
---------------------

There are a few things you should do once you spawn in your nice and
clean Robotics office.

First, keep your metal organized, and understand how much each machine
will take (and you will always need more metal). Second, glass and
flashes are important for your robotics work, as are various devices,
security equipment and rare minerals. Third, have a plan before you
start building anything huge, like a mech suit (without the circuitry,
they are useless). Fourth, make sure to perform maintenance on cyborgs
that come in; NanoTrasen usually doesn't load them with anything but the
minimum required power cells. Finally, ensure you have proper eye
protection when you weld, or you'll become blind quickly.

Cyborgs
-------

Creating, repairing, and maintaining [cyborgs](/wiki/Cyborg "wikilink") is the
main reason you're around. See the [Guide to
Robotics](/wiki/Guide_to_Robotics "wikilink") for more info.

Mechs
-----

Another thing you can do as a Roboticist is make a Mech suit. These can
be tremendously helpful or tremendously annoying depending on who uses
it. They take more work to make than robots and require special
circuits, which are obtained through the
[Quartermaster](/wiki/Quartermaster "wikilink") or the Research and
Development console.

<b>Please note that walking around the station in a mech when not
transporting it or using it for its intended purpose is frowned upon!
They're industrial tools, not personal carriages.</b>

See more about Mechs and their equipment on the
[Mechs](/wiki/Mechs "wikilink") page.

Traitoring
----------

Traitoring as a Roboticist is fun and easy, especially since you spawn
with flashes, and an expectation of building very dangerous machines.
Your high station access, and access to tech storage will allow you to
get pretty much everywhere, also you have gloves from the get go. And,
of course, [emagging](/wiki/Syndicate_Items#Electromagnetic_Card "wikilink")
any of your basic creations serves to cause havoc and chaos. Emagging
the cyborgs can make them do what you want. Some people will ignore,
tell on, or attack you.

Note that to [emag](emag "wikilink") a cyborg, you should follow these
steps:

1.  Use and Emag or ID to unlock the cover.
2.  Crowbar open the cover.
3.  Use Emag again.

Do's and Don'ts
---------------

**Do:**

-   Make cyborg bodies and install MMI's in them.
-   Try to borg antagonists instead of the death penalty. They still
    fail, but are no longer a danger.
-   Cut AI control when the AI is rogue.
-   Make useful bots and leave them around the station.
-   Make a Ripley before combat mechs, mining usually likes this (and
    hopefully will like you).
-   Put beacons in all mechs lest they get stolen.
-   Make a Cyborg and Exosuit Control Console.
-   Try to make your own boards by getting acid from chemistry and
    getting R&D to sync the servers.
-   Recognise that the QM might be more inclined to get you some
    metal/robot assemblies if you don't eat up all of their points with
    Ripley boards.

**Don't:**

-   Put an MMI in a borg without making sure it's still there (they can
    speak you know).
-   Blow all the borgs because one was emagged.
-   Immediately blow all borgs in malf.
-   Try to make a mech you don't have materials for, nothing is more
    useless than a pile Durand limbs while you beg for metal and silver.
-   Go on mech rampages 'because you can'.
