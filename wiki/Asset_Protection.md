These are the guys you send when the [Emergency Response
Team](/wiki/Emergency_Response_Team "wikilink") won't be enough. Asset
Protection is part of a special CentCom task force, one that is usually
sent in response to mutiny, or when the station is completely and
utterly fucked. This is usually because [xenomorphs](alien "wikilink")
have replaced the entire crew, a Head of Staff is being held hostage, or
a [Mercenary](/wiki/Mercenary "wikilink") or two is terrorizing the station.
They're armed to the teeth, and have no shortage of equipment. They will
use force against anyone and everyone who stands in their way.

Like the Emergency Response Team, Asset Protection troopers are
administrated by the [NanoTrasen Defense
Force](/wiki/NanoTrasen_Defense_Force "wikilink"). However, unlike ERT, Asset
Protection's objectives are exclusively military-grade protection. When
they aren't aboard the station, they are often hunting down pirates and
smugglers, and thus their availability is only for the most serious
incidents.

Unfortunately, Asset Protection teams such as [Zulu
Team](/wiki/Zulu_Team "wikilink") have gained a notorious reputation as being
NanoTrasen's "Deathsquad." As in, there are numerous conspiracy theories
claiming Asset Protection are in fact murderers for hire who have killed
the inhabitants of entire stations. These allegations are, naturally,
absurd. If you don't want to take our word for it, ask yourself what a
"Deathsquad" would even accomplish. It's not practical, and it's not
something that could be covered up, even if NanoTrasen *was* the
mega-evil corporation that [some people](/wiki/Syndicate "wikilink") say it
is.

Equipment
---------

![Mk1 Asset Protection
Armor](Deathsquadofficer.png "fig:Mk1 Asset Protection Armor") The Asset
Protection team is by-far the most well prepared and armed force that
you will ever see in your life. The chances of winning against these
officers is almost null. Pray quietly that they are incompetent enough
to not be able to use a pulse rifle. You'd be hard pressed to find
anything more robust than what these men carry around as standard duty
issue.

Asset Protection troopers are usually equipped with the best equipment
NanoTrasen has to offer:

-   Personal preference of firearms, both energy and ballistic, up to
    and including heavy military hardware like Pulse Rifles and surplus
    [USDF](/wiki/USDF "wikilink") Service Rifles.
-   Personal preference of melee weapons.
-   Energy shields.
-   C4 explosives.
-   All manner of grenades.
-   Highly advanced Asset Protection body armor, both in the form of Mk1
    "SWAT" suits, and Mk2 Hardsuits, depending on preference.
-   CentCom headsets.
-   First aid kits.
-   Optical thermal scanners.

### Mecha

The Asset Protection teams are sometimes granted usage of the military
grade mechs such as Seraphs, Marauders, and Gorillas. Due to their cost,
these are only used in case of the most severe emergencies, usually
because the threat that they are encountering can easily tear up the
officers' flesh in a matter of seconds, even with the power armor worn.

The Seraphs and Marauders are armed with high precision laser cannons,
AC 10 scattershot, pulse cannons, and a variety of other equipment,
including fail-safe systems.

The Gorilla mech is a captured [Space Nazi](/wiki/Space_Nazi "wikilink") mech
that is equipped with an 88mm cannon that can one-shot most other mechs,
a rapid firing machine gun, and a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS),
not to mention stupidly thick armor plating. The Gorilla's only known
weaknesses are its power consumption, which requires it to use a tesla
power relay while stomping around, and also the Gorilla's slow speed,
which can be exploited to flank it or run away.

The chances of survival for anyone that has to go up against the mechs
is essentially zero. That is why when the mechs show up, everybody
panics no matter what they were sent in for.

Duties
------

-   Establishing a general plan to go on whilst eliminating the threat,
    usually supplied by a Central Command Official/Admiral.
-   Prepping themselves and assuming roles in a timely manner, usually
    forming squads.
-   Arrival on the station, securing anything that they were told to,
    and killing <u>anyone</u> dumb enough to get in the way of that
    objective; **including the crew.**
-   Patrol around the station, areas being secured until confirmed
    clear.
-   Handling a threat appropriately, and <s>violently</s> carefully.
-   Evacuation of the Asset Protection team after threat is handled, or
    the entire station is dead.

### Additional

-   If civilians are encountered in a room, a quick flashbang will take
    care of any hostiles followed up by stun-function on the rifles.
-   If the Asset Protection team is told to nuke the station, they will
    be supplied with a nuclear fission device, detonation codes, and an
    authorization disk.
-   If the Asset Protection team faces too many casualties on their
    side, they retreat to the shuttle and confirm their numbers before
    leaving, followed by a Bluespace Artillery shelling of the station.

In short
--------

If you see something, run this quickly through your mind:

1.  Is it wearing Asset Protection team gear? If so, skip to last step.
2.  Is it Ian? If so, skip to last step.
3.  Is it *not* interfering with your mission? If so, skip to last step.
4.  Is it *not* your objective? If so, skip to last step.
5.  Shoot the crap out of it.
6.  Carry on patrolling.

Notable members
---------------

-   [James Townes](/wiki/James_Townes "wikilink") (formerly) - Overseer of
    Asset Protection prior to his defecting to the Syndicate, followed
    by his death.
-   [Avalon](/wiki/Avalon "wikilink") - Overseer of Asset Protection after
    Townes was killed during [Operation
    Magnum](/wiki/Operation_Magnum "wikilink").
-   [Zulu 01](/wiki/Zulu_01 "wikilink") - Although Zulu is normally just a
    callsign for the Asset Protection team members, Zulu 01 is almost
    always the same individual. No one knows his real name, but he seems
    to be the current team leader stationed in
    [Virgo-Erigone](/wiki/Virgo-Erigone "wikilink").
