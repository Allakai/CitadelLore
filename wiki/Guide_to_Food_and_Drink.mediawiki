==Fullness==

As you walk and move about on station, your starting nutrition bar will start to drain from starting green, down to dark red; if your hunger bar turns black, you've eaten way too much. The effects of fullness and hunger are equally bad, so it is best to stay at a happy medium. So keep in mind how much you've eaten and how long it has been since you last ate, and you will be fine. 

Go with the rule that, "If you have a hard time getting it down, don't eat any more". Note that nutrition is typically slow-release, so if you don't fill up immediately, you will in the near future.

Several reagents will increase your fullness:
* Very effective: Nutriment, found in most foods. The main one and most effective; Corn oil; Animal Protein, found in meat and Egg Yolk.
* Somewhat effective: Ketchup, Sugar, Sprinkles, Coco powder, Corn oil, Cherry jelly.
* Some alcoholic drinks.

===Starvation===

[[File:food1.png|50px]][[File:food2.png|50px]][[File:food3.png|50px]][[File:food4.png|50px]][[File:food5.png|50px]]

If you drop to dark red, you move very slowly and your description reveals your lack of eating habits. You are starving, this is not good! You will move slowly until you eat some food, so head to the [[chef]] for a burger or slice of meatbread!

Some things will decrease your hunger faster:
* Vomiting
* Being cold (by exposure to cold environments or because you were in a cryo tube)
* Recovering from blood loss
* Taking Lipozine
* Some viruses

If you eat too much, your description will note that you are "chubby". Too little, and you will be described as "malnourished".
Food will also factor into your characters Weight. Gain weight by eating food, lose weight by walking or working out in the stations [[Gym]].

=== FOOD ALLERGY AND REACTIONS. ===
While on other servers the races have mechanically included allergies (such as Skrell and animal proteins.) We have removed most code pertaining to these. But there are still reactions that you must take into account. Some drinks and food will raise and lower body temperature for example. Please be mindful of the species you are serving to. As a example Teshari should not be given Antifreeze or foods that raise their body temperature.

'''''<u>Please Help us keep this list up to date!</u>''''' (if you know of a reaction not listed, Then please add it or flag someone done in our #wiki Discord Channel.

===Outside Recipe Lists===
Due to how often the recipe lists change, and the nature of wiki-editing, Two external sites have been created for the purpose of offering a convenient full list of Virgos many food and drink recipes. (Warning, may also be out of date. Please check the top of the page for date of publishing. If they are out of date by a month please tell us on our [https://discordapp.com/invite/0yCTdQTDRZL5CFSN discord]. Otherwise, We will try our best to keep the recipe pages and wiki guides up to date.) '''NOTE:''' These pages will only contain what the ingredients are, not how to cook it. Consider this more a In-character friendly reference guide.

Click here for the current recipe lists: [https://vore-station.net/infodump/recipes_drinks.html '''VOREStation Drink List'''] and [https://vore-station.net/infodump/recipes_food.html '''VOREStation Food List'''].

==Drinks==

'''IMPORTANT:'''
Many of these drinks, while they do have toxic ingredients, are not toxic in and of themselves. However, because they have toxic ingredients, if you mess them up, you will poison your patrons--not something a good bartender wants to do. An evil one, though... 

'''EXAMPLES:'''
* Kahlua = Coffee Liqueur
* Vodka = Tunguska Triple Distilled
* Whiskey = Uncle Git's Special Reserve

===Alcoholic Drinks===
Alcoholic drinks contain ethanol. Each drink is given a numerical value, that reflects how much it takes to raise you one stage of drunkenness. '''Lower numbers mean the drink is stronger.''' Depending on how much you drink, you may slur your speech, get dizzy, start stumbling around, and even pass out. Just as in real life, the more slowly you drink, the less you are affected by alcohol. Some species have special reactions to alcohol: Skrell will always treat any alcohol as extremely strong, and will get very drunk, very quickly. Humans will take liver damage from drinking too much; this damage happens at around the same level where the character passes out.

====Mixed Drinks====
Since a drinking glass will hold only 30 units of liquid, it's recommended that bartenders use their drink shakers to concoct these drinks before pouring them out.

In order to create some of these items you will either need to mix the regents by hand or toss them into the blender/grinder and grind them. After which either a finished product will be produced or you will need to transfer the liquid to your CondiMaster Neo in the freezer to create it into a bottle.

Any recipe listed as '''Grind''' will require the use of the blender, any recipe listed as '''Mix''' only requires the beaker. All of your juices will require the Grinder's other setting '''Juice'''.

=Tips=
* Milk, Soy Milk, Berry Juice, Soy Sauce, Hot Sauce, Cold Sauce, and Sugar are all measured in reagent units rather than by number of containers. They can be poured directly into the microwave.
* Sliceable foods can be divided into smaller portions by slicing them. Their reagents are divided equally into the slices. The slices noted here are the maximum number of slices, which you can get by using a precise cutting tool like a kitchen knife, cleaver, or scalpel; crude cutting tools, like axes, shovels, and saws will result in fewer slices.
* Condiments are reagents can be added to food, possibly increasing their nutrition value or adding some fun extras. A chef can create condiments by grinding up things that contain them and isolating them in the CondiMaster in the back room. Condiments let you put ketchup on your fries, salt in your soup, dylovene on your fish fingers, or psilocybin on your ghost burger--the possibilities are endless. Foods hold a maximum of fifty units of reagents.
* Some poisonous foods can be prepared safely if Dylovene is added to the finished product, or if the poisonous reagent is neutralized somehow. Experienced chefs only!
* Traitor chefs can make some sneaky substitutions.
** Poisonous apples can be used in all apple dishes, and the final dish will be poisoned. Unlike poisonous mushrooms, cyanide apples can easily kill.
** Slime jelly can be substituted for cherry jelly, and will poison the resulting food.
** Anything made with meat can be made with human meat. (It's still necessary to emag the gibber before butchering one's murder victims.)
* Blood is not necessarily poisonous. It is always the same type as the person the brain was taken from, and if the type is incompatible with the recipient, it will cause a rejection reaction. O-negative blood is always safe.
* Units of egg are obtained by breaking eggs into beakers.

==Advanced Cooking==
Some reagents in the finished products are poisonous, you may want to serve these items safely. This is where a little chemistry can help neutralize or remove the dangerous reagents from your food.Any given piece of food can contain only 50 units of reagents.

When using Dylovene, it's okay to use more than you strictly need. Other chemicals you might use to neutralize poison aren't so forgiving, and some are poisonous themselves.

{| class="sortable" width="550" style="text-align:left; background-color:#FFFFFF;" border="1" cellspacing="0"
! style="background-color:Aqua;" |Reagent
! style="background-color:Aqua;" |How to Neutralize
|-
| Animal Protein; Egg Yolk
| Harmless to most people, animal protein, including egg yolk, is unsafe for Skrell. A one-to-one ratio of Dylovene to animal protein will make it safe for Skrell to eat.
|-
| Blood
| Blood is not necessarily poisonous. It is always the same type as the person it was taken from, and if the type is incompatible with the recipient, it will cause a rejection reaction.
O-negative blood is always safe.
Add one unit of Dylovene for every four units of blood.
Alcoholic drinks made with blood, of any type, are safe; just be sure there is no blood left over after the reaction.
Blood can also be neutralized with Clonexadone (1 unit Clonexadone to 5 units Blood), or by adding drink ingredients to create a blood-based drink.
|-
| Carpotoxin
| Anything made with carp meat will have carpotoxin in it. Counter it with 1 unit Dylovene per 3 units Carpotoxin. Carpotoxin also reacts with copper and cryptobiolin to form rezadone, but overdose of rezadone starts at 15 units and most carpotoxin-containing foods have five or more units of it.
|-
| Amatoxin
| Found in mushrooms. Add 1 unit Dylovene per 2 units Amatoxin.
|-
| Toxin
| Add 1 unit Dylovene per 2 units Toxin.
|-
| Slime Jelly
| Will poison your customers no matter how much Dylovene you add. Adding Dylovene (around 30 units or so) will keep them from dying of the poisoning before they can get to Medical, but if you're not a traitor, do you want to serve them such a painful dish? (No, don't answer that. We know customers can be annoying; that's still no excuse to poison them.)
|-
| Radium
| Found in roast diona and will cause radiation poisoning. Add 1 unit of Dylovene per unit of Radium; reacts to form Hyronalin.
|-
| Sulphuric Acid
| Dylovene won't cut it for sulphuric acid, which will burn as well as poison anyone unlucky enough to ingest it. Instead, neutralize each 1 unit of Sulphuric acid with either 3 units of Corn Oil (creates glycerol), 4 units of Soy Milk (creates soy sauce), or 5 units of wine (creates Acid Spit, an alcoholic cocktail).
|-
| Polytrinic Acid
| You're serious about serving that xeno meat, huh? Well, don't serve it plain; polytrinic acid will poison, burn, and generally kill your customers in a rather nasty manner. Like with sulphuric acid, dylovene isn't enough, but unlike sulphuric acid, it's not easy to neutralize. Polytrinic acid will react with foaming agent and either iron or aluminum to create metal foam, and 10 units of polytrinic acid and 20 units of plasticide will create plastic. When working out how to do this, remember that plasticide is poisonous and metal foam can be chipped through with a kitchen knife.
|-
| Alcohol
| An equal amount of Ethylredoxrazine reacts with Alcohol (including alcoholic drinks) to make water.
|-
| Synaptizine
| Synaptizine is poisonous, but the bigger problem is that it hangs around in the system for a long time. For every unit of synaptizine, you need 30 units of Dylovene.
|-
| Phoron
| Really, now? You could neutralize phoron by adding 2 rum and 1 vermouth per unit, but eating phoron is still a bit of a waste.
|-
