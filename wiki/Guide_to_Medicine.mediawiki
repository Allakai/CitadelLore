=Foreword=
The original guide was compiled by a community effort led by WickedTempest and ported here.

Important reminder that it's possible to stabilize anyone no matter their condition, it just depends on what's available for you to treat them. Obviously not every situation presents ideal circumstances. Don't beat yourself up over something that you see now as a simple fix well after the whole ordeal has passed. Just learn, and keep learning.

Lastly, if you're only joining medical for kinky redhead stutter slut nurse scenes with no intention of doing your job or learning how to do it, then '''you really shouldn't be playing medical.'''

=A Friendly Reminder From The Admins=
As tempting as it may be to help, remember that it is against the rules to do things like breaking into medbay to treat patients when there are active medical staff on duty. Bandaging up minor injuries with the publicly available first aid kits is usually fine, as is performing CPR or otherwise preventing someone from dying until the medics arrive, but don't go outright doing someone's job for them.

At the very least, give the medics a chance to respond - nobody wants to drop everything they're doing and haul ass across the station with a rollerbed only to find that cargo were already on the scene with a crate of medical supplies and healed the patient up to full in the time it took for them to run from medbay to the gateway.

=Triage=
Triage is medical's word for "priority" regarding patients. The goal of triage is to '''stabilize patients, not cure to 100%.''' Generally this comes into play when there is ''more than one'' patient. Wearing a pair of [[File:PGlasses.png]] AR-Ms (HUDs work as well, though they are inferior) will allow you to assess a patient's overall health from a glance via a health bar floating above their character.
*'''No Healthbar''': 100% Health
*[[File:Hudgreen.png]]'''<span style="color:green">Green''': 78-99% Health
*[[File:Hudyellow.png]]'''<span style="color:orange">Yellow''': 42-71% Health
*[[File:Hudred.png]]'''<span style="color:red">Red''': 1-21% Health
*[[File:Hudfred.gif]]'''<span style="color:crimson">Red, Flashing''': -40-0% Health
*[[File:Hudcritical.gif]]'''<span style="color:maroon">Critical!''': -85:-50% Health
*[[File:Huddead.png]]'''Dead''': -100% Health

Patients between Critical and Yellow deserve treatment first with priority starting at Critical and going up. The main exception to this is if any patient that isn't dead is bleeding (including internal bleeding) and/or has severe internal organ damage, as leaving a patient with these conditions may worsen their overall health rather quickly. From there, get all patients to at least Yellow before resolving the rest of their issues.

===Dead Patients===
If the patient dies right there or is reported to have died recently, defib them ASAP. If they do not resuscitate, leave them be and tend to the other patients. Do not waste more time than you need to on dead people; either assign another doctor to deal with them or come back to them later once everyone else is healed to Yellow.

===Cryogenics===
Cryo is all about suspending someone in animation and healing them to boot! If someone is in a pretty bad way, tossing them into a (correctly setup) cryo tube will help with most problems on the surface. Even if the damage isn't healed, the cryo tube is basically one gigantic stasis bag minus the terribly short oxygen supply.

==Viral Triage==
Though rare and seldom (if at all) seen outside of adminbus, a crew member that has been infected with a pathogen signifies the need to act quickly. This list of tasks should be accomplished:
#Clean up all biohazards (blood, mucus, etc) within medical, instruct sanitation staff to put heightened effort into carrying this out.
#Retrieve a blood sample from an infected crew member and announce the presence of a pathogen, and for all crew feeling ill to report to medical.
#Assign tasks to doctors:
#*One doctor to administer Spaceacillin to arriving crew members and escort them to the quarantine area of Virology.
#*One doctor to develop antibodies in test subjects to harvest and dilute to distribute to crew.
#*One doctor to incubate and grow a sample of the virus for detailed analysis. This will allow HUDs and AR-Ms to identify crew that are infected.
#Distribute doses of the antibodies to crew (1u mixed in 4u of water will work).

=Diagnostics=
It's important to remember that '''[[File:Syringes.png]]syringes cannot''' be used on multiple patients, and will need to be replaced with a fresh syringe that doesn't have it's cap removed.

==Damage Types==

===<span style="color:red"><u>Brute</u></span>===
Cuts, lacerations, and bruising all make up the red number on the health analyzer, normally caused by physical trauma such as punching, getting hit with something, being dragged with open wounds, slamming into walls, etc. Sometimes high brute values may break bones, which will require [[Surgery]], or the limb may even become dismembered! Treatment for brute damage on it's own is listed below:
* [[Medical Items#Advanced Trauma Kit|'''Advanced Trauma Kits''']]: Heals 3 brute on the target limb immediately and will allow it to heal on it's own if the damage is below 50. The 3 damage that's taken off works even if the patient is dead, which may be useful if a defib is unable to resuscitate someone due to high damage. ATKs also disinfect wounds if applied early.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Bicaridine''']]: A red colored medicine which heals 6 brute per unit, meaning a full (15u) syringe will heal 90 brute damage. Best utilized in liquid form, overdoses at 30u.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Tricordrazine''']]: A purple medicine that heals all <u>underlined</u> damage, albeit slowly, healing 1.5 damage per unit. Best utilized in liquid form but not alone, no overdose.

===<span style="color:orange"><u>Burn</u></span>===
Skins, burns, and scars make up the yellow number on the health analyzer, normally caused by intense temperatures such as fire, extremely cold temperatures, lasers, and electrocution. Exceptionally high burn values may vaporize a limb, and can cause bloodloss on top of easily becoming infected. Massive amounts of burn damage may cause your character to be 'husked,' unable to be resuscitated no matter what you do. Treatment for burn damage on it's own is listed below:
* [[Medical Items#Advanced Burn Kit|'''Advanced Burn Kits''']]: Essentially the burn variant of ATKs. Primarily used to disinfect burn wounds.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Kelotane''']]: A yellow colored medicine which heals 6 burn per unit, meaning a full (15u) syringe will heal 90 burn damage. Overdoses at 30u.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Dermaline''']]: An orange-yellow colored medicine which heals 12 burn per unit. Overdoses at 15u (one full syringe, be careful).
* '''KeloDerm''': A yellow colored medicine with Kelotane and Dermaline mixed in 1:1. Since the medicines are separate, they work quicker, though KeloDerm doesn't heal as much as Dermaline alone. Overdoses at 30u.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Tricordrazine''']]: A purple medicine that heals all <u>underlined</u> damage, albeit slowly, healing 1.5 damage per unit. No overdose.

===<span style="color:green"><u>Toxin</u></span>===
Damage dealt by toxins make up the green number on the health analyzer, normally caused by poisons, overdosing, phoron exposure/phoron-infected clothes, radiation, infections/necrosis, damaged liver, and critical blood levels. Treatment for toxin damage on it's own is listed below:
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Dylovene''']]: A green colored medicine which heals 4 toxin per unit, and can treat the liver if it's damage is below 10. No overdose (there is but it just treats itself).
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Carthatoline''']]: A grey colored medicine which heals 8 toxin per unit, but has the side effect of inducing nausea in the patient. Can treat liver damage. No overdose.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Arithrazine''']]: A green colored medicine which heals 10 toxin per unit, but has the side effect of causing minor brute damage. It also metabolizes very slowly. Overdoses at 30u.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Tricordrazine''']]: A purple medicine that heals all <u>underlined</u> damage, albeit slowly, healing 1.5 damage per unit. No overdose.

===<span style="color:blue"><u>Suffocation (Hypoxia)</u></span>===
Damage dealt by lack of oxygenated blood being pumped through the body makes up the blue number on the health analyzer, normally caused by suffocation, low blood levels, heart damage, and lung damage. Treatment for hypoxia on it's own is listed below:
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Inaprovaline''']]: A cyan colored medicine which doesn't actually heal hypoxia, but instead halts any further damage. Overdoses at 60u.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Dexalin''']]: A blue colored medicine which heals 15 oxy per unit. Overdoses at 30u.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Dexalin Plus''']]: A blue colored medicine which heals '''150 oxy''' per unit. Best utilized in pill form (though this reduces healing down to 75 oxy per unit) or in a dropper set to one unit, overdoses at 15u (one full syringe).
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Tricordrazine''']]: A purple medicine that heals all <u>underlined</u> damage, albeit slowly, healing 3 oxy damage per unit. No overdose.

===<span style="color:grey">Genetic</span>===
Damage dealt by either radiation, slime digestion, or from popping out of an unupgraded growing vat makes up genetic damage, which the health analyzer can only determine by means of a red prompt, requiring a body scanner for a precise measurement of genetic damage. Treatment for clone damage is listed below:
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Cryoxadone''']]: A pale blue medicine which heals the above damage including genetic damage, but requires that the body be cooled to 170 Kelvin or lower, usually by means of cryo cells.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Clonexadone''']]: A pale blue medicine which works exactly the same as Cryoxadone, but does everything faster.
* '''Cryo-Mix''': A 1:1 mix of Cryoxadone and Clonexadone, works much like KeloDerm in that the two medicines work separately, therefore faster.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Rezadone''']]: A grey medicine which heals genetic damage without the need for cold temperatures. Overdoses at 30u, though 10u may induce dizziness.

===<span style="color:lime">Radiation</span>===
Damage dealt by exposure to the Supermatter, being EVA during a solar flare, being injected with radioactive reagents, or destroying/activating particular artifacts make up radiation damage, which the health analyzer can only determine by means of a red prompt, requiring a body scanner for a precise measurement of radiation damage. Treatment for radiation damage is listed below:
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Hyronalin''']]: A green medicine which heals 30 radiation per unit, albeit slowly, but does not heal the resulting damage of radiation. Overdoses at 30.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Arithrazine''']]: A green medicine which heals 70 radiation and 10 toxin per unit, but has the side effect of dealing some brute damage. Overdoses at 30u.

===<span style="color:purple">Organ</span>===
Damage represented on the body scanner that corresponds with the trauma inflicted on organs, either by certain poisons, severe physical trauma, bones moving in the area organs are present (lower body, chest, head), or certain items necessary for function being absent. An organ is considered dead at 30 damage. Treatment for organ damage is listed below:
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Peridaxon''']]: A purple medicine which heals 1 organ damage per unit, and heals all internal organs. Overdoses at 10u.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Alkysine''']]: A yellow medicine which heals 30 organ damage per unit, but only heals the brain. Overdoses at 30u.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Imidazoline''']]: A pale lavender medicine medicine which heals 5 organ damage per unit, but only heals the eyes. Overdoses at 30u.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Dylovene''']]: A green medicine which heals 2 organ damage per unit, but only heals the liver if it's below 10 organ damage. No overdose.
* [[Guide to Chemistry#Medicine|'''Carthatoline''']]: A grey medicine, works the same as Dylovene in it's use in healing the liver, but can heal it at any damage. No overdose.

==Other==

===Blood Loss===
Blood carries oxygen to various areas in the body of a patient, and without oxygenation (whether by lack of air or lack of blood, in this case) the patient will slowly decline in health until they die, therefore stopping bleeding is <u>your top priority</u>, and should be treated as a critical injury. For low blood levels, administering Dexalin will help with the oxy damage resulting from blood loss, and will help alleviate the risk of brain damage as a result. Critical blood levels, however, will result in massive spikes of hypoxia and annoying toxins, though this only occurs at 40% blood volume. Treatment to stop bleeding is listed below:
*For external bleeding cases:
**'''Pressure''': Getting an aggressive grab and help intent clicking the limb with the grab in hand will apply pressure to the wound, slowing the bleeding, but not stopping it entirely. If ''you'' are bleeding, help intent click the limb and you will begin applying pressure. This should only be used if you have nothing to treat the bleeding and are waiting on someone else to bring gauze/ATKs.
**'''[[Medical_Items#Roll_of_gauze|Gauze]]''': This is the most basic item in medical to treat cuts and lacerations provided you have enough of it.
**'''[[Medical_Items#Advanced_Trauma_Kit|Advanced Trauma Kit]]''': ATKs are better than gauze as they can disinfect the wound when it's used, and instantly heals 3 brute damage on the limb it's applied to.
*For internal bleeding (IB) cases:
**'''Cryogenics''': Placing a patient with internal bleeding into a (correctly setup) cryo tube will both halt (not fix) the bleeding ''and'' stop it from getting worse. This is a temporary solution.
**'''[[Guide_to_Chemistry#Medicine|Bicaridine and Inaprovaline]]''': These two medicines together (they have to be together, not separate) will prevent the internal bleeding from worsening, but will not halt the bleeding.
**'''[[Surgery#Internal_Bleeding|Surgery]]''': The main method of treating internal bleeding is through surgery by means of the Fix'O'Vein.
**'''[[Guide_to_Chemistry#Medicine|Myelamine]]''': A medicine found in (expensive) clotting kits that will seal any internal bleeding. The fastest way to treat.
**'''[[Guide_to_Chemistry#Medicine|Bicaridine]]''': Overdosing Bicaridine (30u) will, of course, deal toxins to the patient, but it may clot internal bleeding. Generally a last resort if none of the other methods are available.
Once the bleeding has ceased, you will have to help the patient raise their blood count. The following are some methods to assist with that:
*'''[[Guide_to_Chemistry#Medicine|Dexalin/Dexalin Plus]]''': Will assist in oxygenating the blood, helping to prevent potential brain damage.
*'''Iron''': A simple reagent that ''must be ingested'' in order to work. Replenishes 8u of blood per unit.
*'''Nutriment''': Basic nutrients that can be found in protein shakes. Must be ingested. Replenishes 4u of blood per unit.
*'''Protein''': Animal proteins found in meat and protein shakes. Must be ingested. Replenishes 4u of blood per unit.
*'''20 Iron, 20 Nutriment, 20 Protein''': The three reagents mentioned above in one 60u pill, which can replenish blood rather quickly as there are three separate reagents.
*'''IV Drip with compatible blood''': Bloodbags can hold 200u of blood (a little less than half a patient's total blood volume) and is generally the best method of replacing blood.

===Infection===
Infections sprout when a wound isn't treated and disinfected in time, and is accompanied by a fever (check temperature). If left alone, infections can rapidly kill a patient, even exponentially if it's bad enough. Infections are commonly identified by means of the body scanner. The following are the levels of infection:
*'''L1 (Mild)''': Pain messages and the start of fever.
*'''L2 (Acute)''': More pain messages, infection becomes more prevalent and visible.
*'''L3 (GANGRENE)''': Beginning of lethal toxins, organ death, and necrosis.
The following are some symptoms of infection based on where it's located:
*'''Meningitis (Brain)'''
**L1: Stiff neck
**L2: Severe headache (+1 confusion at random intervals)
*'''Conjunctivitis (Eyes)'''
**L1: Itchy eyes
**L2: Blurred vision (+10 eye_blurry at random intervals)
*'''Endocarditis (Heart)'''
**L1: Chest tightness
**L2: Chest pain (+25 halloss)
*'''Pyelonephritis (Kidneys)'''
**L1: Lower back pain
**L2: Malaise
*'''Pyogenic Abscess (Liver)'''
**L1: Right side abdomen pain
**L2: Poor blood filtration (toxins buildup)
*'''Pneumonia (Lungs)'''
**L1: Coughing
**L2: Shortness of breath (+30 oxyloss)
*'''Staph Infection (All external limbs)'''
**L1: Pain notificiation
**L2: Sharp pain temporarily disables limb
L2 infections and lower require only 15u of [[Guide_to_Chemistry#Medicine|Spaceacillin]] and monitoring. L3 infections require that Spaceacillin be '''overdosed (45u)''' immediately with Carthatoline to accompany the high toxins. If Carth is unavailable, stack Dylovene and Tricordrazine together. [[Guide_to_Chemistry#Medicine|Corophizine]] can treat infections at any stage before total organ necrosis, and works faster than Spaceacillin, but is disabling and uncomfortable to the patient, and has other side-effects. The following will go over further necessary treatments:
*'''Limb gangrene''':
**Conduct [[Surgery#Necrotic_Limb_Repair|necrotic limb repair]].
*'''Organ necrosis''':
*#Request a replacement synthetic organ from Research immediately. Alternatively you may grow a sleeve of the patient and harvest the sleeve's organ '''with the patient's consent.'''
*#[[Surgery#Organ_Removal.2FTransplantation|Remove the organ via surgery and replace it with the synthetic counterpart]] (good luck if it's the heart).
**If the brain or heart (unless you're fast) is necrotic, the patient will need to be resleeved.

'''A note about necrosis''': If an organ is allegedly necrotic (namely on a printout) but the patient's temperature is normal and there was no previous infection, then ''surprisingly'' the organ isn't actually necrotic at all.

===Fractures===
Bones fractures can be separated by three identifications: hairline, fracture, and broken. These three different types of fractures no longer play any part mechanically, though from an RP standpoint, hairline is the least severe while broken is the most severe (and therefore painful). Fractures can, however, deal damage to organs if they move around. Treatment for fractures is listed below:
*'''[[Medical_Items#Splint|Splints]]''': A half-cast that keeps the fractured bone in place and prevents it from moving. '''This is a temporary remedy,''' and requires the following to actually treat...
*'''[[Surgery#Bone_Repair|Surgery]]''': By means of bone gel and bone setter (or boneclamp if you have one), a fracture can be mended rather quickly.
*'''Osteodaxon''': A rare medicine requiring some [[Guide_to_Chemistry#Vorestation_specific_recipes|magic]] to obtain the precursors for, this medicine can heal fractures without surgery (provided the target limb's damage isn't above the fracture threshold). Do note, however, that it will cause severe pain, and should probably have Tramadol administered alongside it.

====Dislocations====
Not actually a fracture or even a problem related to surgery, but it will function as a fracture in that the limb will become incapacitated. Fixing it simply requires that you stand next to the patient and use the 'Undislocate-Joint' verb. If there are multiple dislocations, a prompt will appear asking which limb you would like to relocate.

=Resleeving=
<small><i>See also: [[Resleeving]]</i></small>

Similar to cloning, Resleeving is a method of reviving someone - to an extent - via technology provided to Nanotrasen by [[Kitsuhana Heavy Industries|KHI]]. Perhaps the main difference between cloning and resleeving is that the mind records are kept separate from the body records, granting the ability to create custom sleeves to put yourself into without the need for brain transplant surgery (which would probably fail anyway due to organ rejection). Mind records are primarily maintained via backup implants provided by medical in reception which will backup the mind state of the patient periodically, with the added benefit of informing medbay staff over the medical frequency if an implant has ceased function, implying the patient has died. Legacy one-time mind scans are available with a SleeveMate, though, if patients don't like blinking pieces of metal in their necks.

===Resleeving Procedure===
The following steps will entail how to correctly resleeve a patient without error.
#Listen for the chime over the medical frequency about a patient's backup implant ceasing to function. This may take fifteen minutes after they have died. Alternatively, follow the rest of this guide if a patient you are caring for has died and cannot be resuscitated.
#*Someone who may or may not be related to the patient's death (which isn't any of your business anyway) may arrive with some of their items in a bag. Take the bag with you but do not look inside.
#'''Check the patient's records.''' If there is a Do Not Resuscitate or Do Not Resleeve (commonly known as a DNR), then simply heed any postmortem instructions provided in the records.
#*If no postmortem instructions are provided, place the body in a body bag with a toe tag including name and transfer to the morgue.
#*A DNR may also be issued by the CMO if it is reasonable (e.g. not "lol don't resleeve them they're a butt") or Central Command as long as hard evidence is supplied that the patient has committed suicide willingly.
#If the patient lacks a mind record and their body is still intact, scan their cadaver with a SleeveMate and select '''Mind-Scan (One Time)'''. A mind record with their name should appear shortly.
#Operate the console and '''ensure the mind scan is present''' before growing the body.
#Begin growing the body and tint the resleeving lab's windows.
#Once the body has been ejected from the growing tube, place it in the cryogenics tube and turn it on until their health reads 100%
#*Assuming the growing tube hasn't been upgraded by research, the patient will be ejected with roughly 20% health due to genetic damage. There's a chance they may also have mutations.
#*It may be a good idea to give the patient a pill of 1u of Ryetalyn to immediately fix any mutations, including blindness and deafness.
#Eject the patient from the cryo tube and '''place a uniform from the spare clothing locker on them.''' If you were given a backpack with the patient's items, place their backpack on their back slot.
#Place the patient in the resleeving tube and sleeve their mind into their body. Eject from the tube and buckle them to the nearest chair.

===Post-Resleeving Procedure===
The following steps entail how to handle the patient once they are conscious post-resleeving. Failure to heed these instructions may jeopardize the patient's mental well being and the credibility of your medical license.
#Shake the patient awake if they aren't already.
#Ask how the patient is feeling, where they are/why they are there, find out what they already know regarding their current situation.
#Start with telling them that you have some bad news.
#*This is considered a 'warning shot' and will prepare the patient to take in negative information.
#Follow with informing them that they have been resleeved.
#*Keeping this simple for the patient to understand is important. '''Misinformation may be detrimental to the patient.'''
#Allow the patient to process this information. Some may understand and be fine, others may be furious or complain, others may just stare blankly and really just want to run out the door to get eaten again <s>and waste your frikkin biomass</s>.
#Ask the patient if they have any questions or concerns. If they ask a question that you do not know the answer to, then inform them that you cannot answer it. '''Avoid speculation.'''
#Advise the patient to relax for a while and inform them of the side effects of resleeving (generally fatigue).
'''Remember''': They are not a ''clone,'' they have only ''been cloned,'' in a sense. They are still themselves.

===Carding===
If a patient doesn't have a body record and their previous body is no longer present or intact, then sleeving a mind record into a card may be necessary to help them design a new body (which will be discussed shortly). Sleeve cards are fully aware of their surroundings and situation and are even able to speak, but cannot do anything beyond that. There's no real reason to use this feature short of the reason above.

===Body Design===
The body design console is located in the reception area of medbay and can be used by anyone, allowing them to design a body similar (but clunkier) to what they can do in character creation. This may also be used in case a patient doesn't have a body record and needs a new one designed. Once a body is designed it will need to be saved to a disk, which are kept in a box on a table behind the windows. Simply insert the disk, save the data onto it, eject it, then insert it into the resleeving console to grow.

=Races=
There are many races on Virgo, even a race that lets you make your own (kinda)! Custom Species aside, some of the vanilla races react a little differently to different treatments. For the purpose of this guide, humans will be used as a base species to compare for the rest of them.

=Loadout=
Improving the likelihood of a patient's survival depends not only on your medical knowledge but also on what's available to you, particularly medicines and equipment on your person. The following will go over optimal loadouts used by many doctors, though nothing is stopping you from experimenting; these are merely recommendations, and it may do well to inquire other experienced medical players as to what their loadout is.

==Necessary Equipment==
The equipment that most doctors have equipped:
*[[File:PGlasses.png]] A pair of [[Medical_Items#AR-M|AR-M glasses]] can evaluate someone's health from a glance, and even hide the health bar if their health is at 100%. Can also show the patient's job icon next to the health bar, but probably the biggest step up from regular HUDs is the fact that it can view suit sensors in a new window. Can also view patient records, allows you to set their physical status (useful for setting patients to SSD or deceased), and allows you to add comments to a patient's record.
*[[File:Medicalbelt.png]] A [[Medical_Items#Medical_Belt|Medical Belt]] to store your medicines. Has seven slots and is obviously worn around the belt slot.
*[[File:Bottles.gif]] Bicaridine, KeloDerm/Dermaline, Dexalin Plus, Dylovene, and Tramadol placed in your belt.
*[[File:Syringes.png]] A syringe to extract said medicines. '''Ensure that you are not sharing the same syringe between patients.''' Holds 15u and draws/injects by 5u with each click. Can fit on your ear.
*[[File:Traumakit.png]][[File:Burnkit.png]] [[Medical_Items#Advanced_Trauma_Kit|Advanced Trauma and Burn Kits]] to help with brute and burn wounds respectively, along with disinfecting them. Typically found in the advanced kit that you spawn with.
*[[File:Healthanalyzer.png]] A [[Medical_Items#Health_Analyzer|Health Analyzer]] for a more in-depth analysis of someone's health. Gives precise numbers as to someone's brute, burn, toxin, and oxy damage, and can even tell if someone has genetic, radiation, or brain damage, though not how much. Will also inform the user if the patient has fractures or internal bleeding, but not their location.
*[[File:Labcoat.png]] A [[Medical_Items#Labcoat|Labcoat]] as per [[Standard Operating Procedure]]. Has storage space on the inside of the coat and allows you to use the suit storage slot.
*[[File:LGloves.png]] A pair of [[Medical_Items#Latex Gloves|Latex or Nitrile gloves]] as per SOP and to prevent infection.
*[[File:Stasis_Bag_Folded.png]] A [[Medical_Items#Stasis_Bag|Stasis Bag]] to transport critical patients. Note that these bags don't halt damage at all like what you may be used to, rather they instead slow it down greatly. They also have a limited air supply, about <s>fifteen</s> SIX MINUTES WORTH OH GOD WHY, meaning time is still of concern, and taking a patient out of the bag will crumple the bag up and make it useless. Two things to note, however: you can scan the patient's vitals through the bag simply by clicking it with the health analyzer, and you can load a syringe into the bag to inject into the patient, which can later be retrieved by using a screwdriver on the bag.
Additional useful equipment is as follows:
*[[File:WWebbing.png]] [[Medical_Items#Webbing.2FDrop_Pouches|Webbing/Drop Pouches]] to store more items. Webbing and drop pouches are mechanically the same, the only difference being the name and sprite. Attaches to the uniform, found in the accessories section of the loadout tab in character setup.
*[[File:Stethoscope.png]] A [[Medical_Items#Stethoscope|Stethoscope]] to diagnose heart and lung injuries. Attaches to the uniform.
*[[File:Rollerbed.png]] A [[Medical_Items#Roller_Bed|Roller Bed]] to transport patients safely without dragging. Simply control click the bed, then click-drag a patient onto the bed and you can start running without having to hunt for pixels to pull it. Fits on your back, though it should probably be in your backpack.
*[[File:PFreezer.png]] A [[Medical_Items#Portable_Freezer|Portable Freezer]] to store organs should someone gib or otherwise have their organs removed.
*[[File:Defib.gif]] A [[Medical_Items#Defibrillator|Defib]] to resuscitate patients that have recently died. Must go on your back in order to use, on top of having the other hand empty to use the paddles. May need to be recharged after each use.
*[[File:Sleevemate.png]] A [[Medical_Items#SleeveMate_3200|SleeveMate]] to scan the minds/bodies of cadavers if they have no records present in the resleeving console.

=Machinery=
Medical has quite a few bits and pieces of stationary equipment to help with the workflow, most of which are elaborated on here:

===[[File:Bscanner.gif]][[File:Bscanner_console.gif]]Body Scanner===
Pretty much a CT and MRI scanner shoved into one futuristic bed and console, and so much more! This is probably one of the most vital pieces of equipment for Medical as it can diagnose pretty much anything wrong with a patient. Some things it can do are, but not limited to:
*Provide information on all of the damage types.
*How much blood the patient has.
*Show what reagents are in the stomach/blood stream, and how much there is.
*Give a detailed analysis of each limb, including fractures, internal bleeding, the presence of implants, and if there are foreign bodies in the limb.
*Print condensed information to hand to a physician in the event the patient requires surgery.

===[[File:Sleeper.gif]][[File:Console.gif]]Sleeper===
Next to - or at least not far away from - the body scanner are sleepers, beds that specialize in treating most side effects of trauma, but are otherwise an endless reservoir of some basic medicines. Some features of the sleeper are:
*Gives estimated readout of patient's health by means of number values and colored bar graphs.
*Allows the injection of:
**Dylovene
**Inaprovaline
**Paracetamol
**Dexalin
*Can conduct dialysis on a patient to remove anything that isn't blood (such as toxins, but medicines are included in this) from their blood stream.
*Stasis ability, with multiple settings to decide how slow the patient's body should take damage or process reagents.
**The lowest setting skips 99 of 100 life ticks.

===[[File:Cryo.gif]]Cyrogenics===
A true marvel of Medical are it's cryogenic tubes, allowing the use of certain medicines that can only be used at sub-zero temperatures, namely Cryoxadone and Clonexadone, which are both capable of healing lots of damage over time. If not for healing genetic damage, it should be noted that one unit of medicine taken from the tube's beaker is multiplied into ten units inside the patient!

====[[File:Freezer.gif]]How to Setup====
While a nice piece of equipment indeed, it requires some prep in order to use it to it's full capacity, namely putting the beakers in and setting the gas cooler. Placing the beakers inside the cryo tube is as simple as taking the beakers on the table in hand and clicking on the tubes with them. As for the gas cooler, head to the storage room and take the stairs to secondary storage. On the west side of the room is a gas cooler, just click on it and set the temperature between 10 and 80 Kelvin, though no lower or higher. Too low could draw a lot of unnecessary power, while setting it too high may slow down how fast the medicine inside the patient can work.

===[[File:Clone.gif]][[File:Resleevingpod.gif]]Resleeving Pods===
Probably the second most used pieces of equipment, these machines are what keep the crew from staying dead<s>, particularly when they get eaten</s>. See the Resleeving heading above about how to use this.

=Goodies From Departments=
Medical has interactions with other departments besides just treating their injuries, surprisingly enough. Research can fabricate new tools and equipment, Cargo can order important medical stuff, and Security can try to get you to break the Non-Disclosure Policy.

==Research==
Research, provided there are miners available, can fabricate a number of nice tools for Medical, most of which will be described here:

===Surgical===
*[[File:Scalpmanager.png]]'''Incision Management System (IMS)''': Requires high tier research and diamonds, but this tool is invaluable to have. One click can create an incision, clamp bleeders, and retract the skin at the same time!
*[[File:Boneclamp.png]]'''Boneclamp''': Requires silver but another amazing instrument to have. Repairs a bone completely in one click, though this will not work for the skull or rib cage without one use of bone gel, otherwise bone repair surgery can be conducted in three clicks with an IMS.
*[[File:Laserscalp.png]]'''Laser Scalpel''': Different versions depending on what's available to Research, but this basically works as a scalpel and hemostat combined when opening an incision.

===Chemistry===
*[[File:BSBeaker.gif]]'''Bluespace Beaker''': Requires diamonds but is immensely useful for chemistry, holding 300u over it's non-bluespace counterpart which can only hold 120u.
*[[File:CryoBeaker.gif]]'''Cryostasis Beaker''': Reagents won't mix or react inside this beaker, but it can only hold 60u. Not very useful outside of easier grenade production.
*[[File:Pinkbabyslime.gif]]'''Pink Slime Extract''': Pink slimes are essentially smarter medibots, but their extract is what we're mostly interested in; injecting 5u of blood will create 30u of Myelamine, while injecting 5u of phoron will create Osteodaxon. Simply grind the core in the grinder to extract the reagents.

===Quality of Life===
*[[File:Mecha_odysseus.png]]'''Odysseus''': A medical mech with three attachments available, usually a syringe gun with two sleepers. Probably the most important feature is the mech's ability to '''scan reagents and synthesize them''', allowing you to replicate rare medicines.
*[[File:Powercell.png]]'''Super Capacity/Hyper Capacity Power Cells''': A few pieces of equipment, namely the Defibs and [[Hardsuit#Rescue_Hardsuit|Rescue RIG]], use power cells to function. Replacing the defib cells will allow more consecutive uses without having to recharge while upgrading the RIG's cell will allow the user to use it's modules more without worrying about losing power after a few uses.
*[[File:AdvancedBedFolded.png]]'''Advanced Roller Bed''': Essentially a regular roller bed but with Scientific(!) blue acrylic paint smeared over it, somehow reducing it's size to better fit in your backpack. Just a smaller bed, pretty much.
*[[File:Medibot.gif]]'''Medibots''': Either helpful, annoying, or totally useless. Swiping your ID over it will unlock it's maintenance panel, allowing you to alter a few options. One option that should be turned on is to report treatments over HUD, while one option that should be turned off is the medibot's speaker as leaving it on will probably make anyone go insane. Probably the most important feature is allowing it to draw from a beaker that you can insert, allowing you to make custom mixes. Unfortunately the bot cannot tell the difference between any of the damage types, only treating a patient once their overall health reaches a certain threshold, therefore take care to '''not load in medicines that the patient can easily overdose on'''.

===Upgrades===
*[[File:Clone.gif]]'''Growing Pod''': Upgrading the growing pod will result in patients that have less clone damage and less chance for mutations, even to the point that all defects are gone entirely. Basically saves a few seconds during the procedure, or allows you to skip the cryogenics tube entirely.
*[[File:Resleevingpod.gif]]'''Resleeving Pod''': Upgrading the resleeving pod will result in less confusion and dizziness for the patient, allowing the to become acquainted easier with their situation.
*[[File:Freezer.gif]]'''Gas Cooler''': Upgrading the gas cooler will allow it to cool the gasses for cryo quicker.

==Cargo==
Conveniently enough, Cargo is right next door to Medical, allowing quick exchanges of supplies and crates, most of which will be described here:
*[[File:SMed.png]]'''Clotting Kit''': A kit filled with autoinjectors containing Myelamine, a medicine that can clot internal bleeding. Rather expensive.
*[[File:VMVoidsuit.png]]'''Vey-Med Voidsuit''': A sleek voidsuit which is a pretty big step up from the regular voidsuits that come stocked every shift.
*[[File:Stasis_Bag_Folded.png]]'''Stasis Bags''': Stasis bags are nice to have but there aren't many. In the event Medical is running low, it's always a good idea to order more.
*[[File:Scalpel.png]]'''Surgical Tools''': If you have to order this crate then something terrible has probably happened to the other tools.
*[[File:Implant_Case.png]]'''Virus Samples''': Virology has no virus samples at the start of the shift, making your job as a Virologist pretty much null. Ordering these crates requires both the authorization and ID of the CMO.

==Security==
Security is an important department but also a rather nosy one. Aside from treating officers and their prisoners, there are some things that you need to remember when dealing with them. Note that Security isn't made up of bad people, and there are some instances where you'll want to call them in case something obviously terrible is happening in medbay.

===Alert Codes===
*<span style="color:green">'''Code Green'''</span>
**Unless the patient consents or an officer has a warrant, Medical cannot divulge information about the patient.
**Warrants usually only give access to body scans and medical records.
**Warrants can request a psychiatric evaluation of a patient, but officers are not permitted to listen in on the evaluation itself.
**Requesting the locations of individuals requires a very good reason, or a warrant.
*<span style="color:blue">'''Code Blue'''</span>
**Security does not need a warrant to access patient info such as records, location, autopsies, or body scans. If it's relevant and they ask for it, provide it.
**Security still does not, however, have access to what a patient divulged to a psychiatrist ''unless'' it's directly related to the alert level elevation.
*<span style="color:red">'''Code Red'''</span>
**You '''need''' to provide information about a patient upon request as long as it's relevant.
**Suspicious confessions from a psychiatric appointment should probably be mentioned to security.

===Charges===
*'''Trespassing''': If they aren't Medical and they don't have any Medical personnel attending to them and they just ran in just because they could, call Security. They don't need to be in medbay, they'll get in the way of everything, and they pose a rather large risk to patient confidentiality.
*'''Neglect of Duty''': If the chemist makes only a few bottles of medicine and rushes elsewhere to do something less productive then you can probably smash this charge over their head. Doctors hanging out in the bar instead of manning the medbay when there's patients awaiting treatment? Neglect of duty, maybe even manslaughter if a patient dies as a result.
*'''Disrespect to the Dead''': Doing anything to a corpse outside of what's elaborated on in their postmortem instructions may land you with this charge, though this mostly only applies when someone decides to butcher, mutilate, or violate the body. Oh yeah, and '''EATING THE CORPSE FALLS UNDER THIS AS WELL.'''
*'''Animal Cruelty''': Monkeys are used for experimentation and harvesting antibodies in the event there's a viral outbreak, though some experiments aren't experiments in the slightest, particularly when the experiment's data doesn't yield anything useful at all, namely testing reagents to see what happens, pouring acid on a monkey to see how fast they die, 'experimenting' with Mutagen, et cetera. Experiment ideas should probably be pitched to the CMO before it is conducted.
*'''Suicide Attempt''': While there's no real legal consequence to this, the patient will have to undergo a psychiatric evaluation with supervision until the shift ends. If the patient is deemed too unsafe to keep within medical then they will have to be transferred to the brig.
*'''Violating Employee Privacy/Breach of Medical Confidentiality''': Essentially releasing any information to anyone who isn't the patient or Medical staff without the patient's consent will land you with breaching the patient's privacy. You cannot divulge a patient's information to anyone, not even the Colony Director or CentCom if they ask you unless it's Code Blue or higher.
