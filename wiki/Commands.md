#### Whisper

Also: whisper "  
You whisper. Anything you say will only be heard on tile adjacent to
you. With every tile between you and the listener, the listener will see
more random asterisks instead of letters.

#### Me

You display a custom emote that you wrote. That means, whatever you
write after you click enter (or Space) will be in the message unless you
erase it.

#### Subtle

Also: subtle "  
You display a custom emote as above, but only visible to people on or
adjacent to your tile.

#### OOC

Also: ooc "  
Use OOC if you want to say things [Out of
Character](/wiki/Out_of_Character "wikilink") to every player.  
Remember to not say things regarding the current round, and if such
things are said nonetheless, to not use the knowledge in-game.

#### Hear/Unhear OOC

Toggles the OOC channel. If you unhear it, you won't see any massages
said with the OOC command.  
Admins can disable the OOC channel for everyone. If the OOC channel is
unheard by/for you, you will still see admin OOC text.

#### Adminhelp

Sends an OOC message which only admins can read. The admin can answer
with a PM directly to you. You can reply to a adminPM by clicking on the
name of the admin.  
Use this to report [griefers](griefer "wikilink") and other rulebreaking
stuff. Report bugs in the
[Bugtracker](https://github.com/Baystation12/Baystation12/issues).

#### Notes

This is your character's memory. If you are the
[Traitor](/wiki/Traitor "wikilink"), you can look up your objectives and your
[Uplink](/wiki/PDA#Messages "wikilink") passcode. If you use freedom implants,
the emotion to active it is automatically noted here as well. You can
add text yourself with the [Add Note](/wiki/Add_Note "wikilink") command.

#### Add Note

This command allows you to add text to your character's memory. You can
look at the text with the [Notes](/wiki/Notes "wikilink") command.

#### Pull

Also: right click and choose "pull".  
Use on any object (characters included) to drag it behind you. You don't
need an empty hand to do so. If you drag a cuffed character or monkey,
they can't move.

#### Point

Also: right click on a tile, choose one of the objects/characters and
click "point".  
Displays a red arrow that points on the appropriate tile and displays a
message "\[Character Name\] points at \[Object Name/Character Name\]",
both of which can be seen by any player whose character has your
character in their line of sight.

#### Examine

Also: right click on an object/character and choose "examine". Gives you
a description of the object or of the Character and what he has in his
equipment slots, except for the pockets.

[module](/wiki/Cyborg#Cyborg_Modules "wikilink"). You can equip and unequip up
to three objects simultaneously.  
The first time you use this command, you have to choose what module you
want to equip.

#### Call the Shuttle

Only if you are the [AI](/wiki/AI "wikilink").  
This command lets you call the shuttle without the need of a
[Communications Console](/wiki/Communications_Console "wikilink").  
Note: The AI can't send back the shuttle. Only humans can do that. It's
a safety precaution.

#### Track with Camera

Only if you are the [AI](/wiki/AI "wikilink").  
This command switches your camera view automatically to the camera that
is closest to your selected target. IF the target is not in the view of
any of your cameras, the game will check every 5 seconds until the
target moves into view, you use the [Cancel Camera
View](/wiki/Commands#Cancel_Camera_View "wikilink") command, or move the
camera. The game will display a notification if the target is not in
view.

#### Cancel Camera View

Cancels viewing a camera or observing an object/person. Useful for when
you cannot exit a certain screen.

This command lets you teleport to the various locations on the map.

#### Observe

If you are a [Ghost](/wiki/Ghost "wikilink"), this command focuses your camera
on a character (or monkey, or other ghost).  
Use the [Cancel Camera View](/wiki/Commands#Cancel_Camera_View "wikilink")
command to abort.

#### Vote

Used to start a vote or to vote if a vote was started.  
There are two kinds of votes:

-   Restart: If more players vote for yes then for no, the round will be
    restarted.
-   Change game mode: You can vote for a game mode. If the majority of
    the players vote for one game mode the round will restart and load
    this game mode. If no majority is formed, the vote will leave the
    game as it is (No Change). If the majority votes equally for
    multiple game modes, this will create a tie and the game mode is
    randomly chosen between those. Change mode votes are disabled during
    the round.
