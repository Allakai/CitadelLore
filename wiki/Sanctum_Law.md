### Low Level Infractions

These Infractions generally are responded to with a slap on the wrist.
More serious or repeated cases generally result in counseling being
given.

Counseling is done by a professional volunteer. Aiding in the violator's
recovery is the top priority as for them to not repeat breaches.

A session of counseling is generally one hour long. Sessions can be
longer if both parties wish to. In cases where a year of counseling is
given, the limit is up to four sessions a week unless incarcerated.
