The **Solar Arrays** are backup power source. They are very useful if
the [Engine](/wiki/Supermatter_Engine "wikilink") is nonfunctional for [some
reason](/wiki/Traitor "wikilink"). As name suggests, solar arrays generate
electrical power from sun. While they won't generate as much as other
power sources, they are reliable and don't require maintenance if
properly set up.

There are five solar arrays on the station:

-   Fore - Located in northern section of EVA Maintenance.
-   Fore Port - Located in Arrivals Maintenance, right next to the
    Primary Tool Storage.
-   Fore Starboard - Located in Bar Maintenance, above the Garden.
-   Aft Port - Located in Engine Maintenance, south of Drone Fabrication
    and Waste Handling. In case of [Engine](/wiki/Engine "wikilink") failure
    this solar is usually damaged.
-   Aft Starboard - Located in Science Maintenance, east of Xenoflora
    Research.

Connecting the Arrays
---------------------

### Required Tools

-   ![](CableCoils.png "fig:CableCoils.png") Several (preferrably
    yellow) [cable coils](/wiki/Cable_Coils "wikilink").
-   ![](Engineer_Hardsuit.png "fig:Engineer_Hardsuit.png") A
    [voidsuit](voidsuit "wikilink") or [hardsuit](voidsuit "wikilink")
    (with oxygen supply).
-   ![](Yellowgloves.png "fig:Yellowgloves.png") Insultated Gloves

### Wiring Setup

None of the five solar arrays are connected to the station at the start.
You will need to connect the solar panels and the solar tracker to the
wire leading from the station.

To wire a tile, hold a cable coil in hand and click an adjacent tile,
this will add a wire radiating from the center of the selected tile
toward your current position. You will see a tiny red "knot" in the
center of the tile, when extending the wire across the tile, make sure
to click the knot in order to form a straight wire. Make sure the wire
coil is in your hands when you click the knot (wiring is often learnt by
trial and error).

Using this method, connect the solar arrays and solar tracker to the
station. Having excessive knotting in your wiring can sometimes cause
power loss, and other such nasties. Knots are best left avoided
altogether for this reason - wire your junctions the same way the solar
panels are already connected together, with the curving wires. You can
also rewire the control room to remove the knots using this same method.

### Calibration

As station is orbiting local sun, solar arrays have to be calibrated
properly. Usually, the easiest way is simply opening the solar array
control console, and pressing the "Auto" button. If you correctly
finished the wiring step, solars should automatically calibrate
themselves. Also, please note that station blocks sunlight. This means
output of solar array is fluctuating between 0 and 90 000 Watts. To
compensate, the [SMES](/wiki/SMES "wikilink") power storage units are used.

### SMES Setup

![](SMES.png "fig:SMES.png") [SMES](/wiki/SMES "wikilink") units store power
generated by solar array and send it to the main grid. As solar arrays
are often used as backup power source it is reccomended to leave the
SMES output offline, until they are needed. Optimal SMES settings are:

-   90 000W Input, charging mode Auto.
-   40 000W Output, charging mode Offline.

This will ensure the SMESs charge as backup power source, which will be
ready should [Engine](/wiki/Engine "wikilink") failure occur. If this happens,
simply turn the SMES outputs to Online. Alternatively the station
[AI](/wiki/AI "wikilink") may do this, if your station is equipped with one.
With all five solar arrays online station should have at least 200 000
Watts of power, which is enough to operate life support, AI and other
important systems.

Solar Maintenance
-----------------

Space is full of dangers. While solar arrays provide reliable power
source, they may be easily damaged by meteors or [other
dangers](/wiki/Traitor "wikilink"). This section will explain how to repair
the array.

### Wiring Damage

This problem may be easily fixed by replacing damaged/missing wiring.

### Solar Panel(s) Damage

Each solar panel is covered by double glass sheet. If this sheet was
damaged it has to be replaced. Crowbar the broken glass out and replace
it. If the panel was completely destroyed obtain replacement solar panel
assembly. Few assemblies should be in Engineering Storage, alternatively
contact [Cargo](/wiki/Cargo "wikilink") department to order more. Wrench the
assembly in place and add protective glass sheets.

### Solar Tracker Damage

Solar tracker is special piece of machinery which ensures the solar
array is properly aligned. If it's destroyed it has to be replaced.
Obtain new solar panel assembly, wrench it in place and then insert
solar tracker circuit board. Then add two glass sheets and your new
tracker is finished.  
*Please note that it is not reccomended to have more than one tracker
for each solar array.*

### SMES Damage

[SMES](/wiki/SMES "wikilink") units are very expensive to replace. For more
information on this complex piece of machinery refer to [SMES
Manual](/wiki/SMES_Manual "wikilink").  
Please note that solar arrays should **NEVER** be wired into the main
grid. If there are two or more arrays in same grid, controllers conflict
which usually results in both arrays ceasing to function.
